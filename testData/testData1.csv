!,Elfrid Payton (right ankle) ruled out vs. GSW:
-,"Justin Jackson getting the start Tuesday: De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield, Nemanja Bjelica and Willie Cauley-Stein are also starting. Jackson is getting the nod with Iman Shumpert resting, but he has limited upside and is just a desperation play in deep leagues."
0,"Kelly Oubre (illness) active for Tuesday: If he's feeling up to it, the Wizards could rely on Oubre a ton in small-ball lineups because they are missing Dwight Howard (back) and Markieff Morris (concussion). The illness adds an element of risk, though."
-,"Kevin Love to be re-evaluated in a few weeks: Love said he initially injured his toe during a preseason game against the Celtics, and with the Cavs opening the year up 0-6, there wasn't much incentive for him to keep pushing through the pain. The toe issue was so painful that it was uncomfortable for him to put any pressure on it, and he did undergo an MRI. He remains without an official timetable, but Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Monday that he could be out for more than a month. Owners should hold on until we get a more definitive timetable, but it's concerning that he has met with renowned foot surgeon Dr. Martin O'Malley. Larry Nance figures to be one of the primary beneficiaries while he's out."
-,"Marquese Chriss (left ankle) is available: Coach Mike D'Antoni noted that Chriss is ready physically, but said he also looked rusty at practice. For that reason,  Isaiah Hartenstein will probably remain ahead of Chriss for now."
-,"Nerlens Noel (ankle) is available Tuesday: Steven Adams (calf) is available too, and unless he has restrictions, Noel is likely looking at minutes in the teens. Noel has been terrific this season, but a healthy Adams severely caps his upside."
+,"Steven Adams, Noel available to play Tuesday: Adams missed Sunday's game vs. the Suns with a minor calf issue, but he should be back in the starting lineup tonight with his usual minutes, which really hurts Noel. Feel free to get Adams active for a favorable matchup in Los Angeles."
-,"No timetable for James Johnson, Dion Waiters: Both these guys have yet to make their regular-season debuts, and based on this quote from Spoelstra, it doesn't seem like either one is close. Kelly Olynyk and Justise Winslow will continue to man the four-spot while Johnson is out, and Rodney McGruder has been one of the biggest beneficiaries with both Waiters and Johnson on the sidelines. At this point, Johnson belongs on the waiver wire in most leagues."
-,"Nurse says shorter stints for JV and Ibaka: Nurse said he doesn't have a preference on who will matchup with Joel Embiid, so Nurse will likely be going with whoever has the hot hand tonight. The timeshare situation at the five-spot in Toronto has been annoying for JV owners, and it's somewhat disheartening that he won't be drawing the start tonight against a more traditional center in Embiid."
-,"Suns decline Dragan Bender's option: The option was for $5.9 million, so it would have been a major upset if the Suns actually picked it up. Bender has shown little to no progress in terms of development and will be labeled a bust until he proves otherwise. Bender has played a total of 11 minutes this season."
0,"De'Aaron Fox (back) available to play Tuesday: Fox didn't seem too limited while going through his pregame routine, so it looks like he'll be fighting through the pain tonight. Just a note, available to play doesn't always mean 'will play,' and with this being the second leg of a back-to-back set, it wouldn't be surprising to see Fox minutes limited tonight. He's safe to fire up in season-long settings, but is a risky play in DFS."
-,"Kawhi Leonard starting, Powell to the bench: The Raptors are bringing Kawhi along slowly since he barely played last season, so his fantasy owners should be aware of upcoming back-to-backs. Toronto's next one is right around the corner on Nov. 4 vs. the Lakers and Nov. 5 vs. the Jazz, but it's not a lock that he misses one of those."
!,"Fred VanVleet (toe) out Tuesday vs. 76ers: This will be the fourth game in a row that FVV will be watching from the sidelines, which will translate to more minutes for Delon Wright and Lorenzo Brown. The Raptors take on the Suns on Friday, and for now, we'll be considering VanVleet questionable for that one."
-,"Aron Baynes (hamstring) will play on Tuesday: Baynes will be returning to the lineup following a three-game absence, and he won't have any minutes restrictions for tonight's game. He could flirt with close to 20 minutes going up against Detroit's more traditional frontcourt, which could somewhat cut into Marcus Morris' minutes. Baynes is not a great target in fantasy hoops, though."
-,"De'Aaron Fox (back) a game-time decision: Fox tweaked his back on a layup late in Monday's win, and with this being the second game of a back-to-back set, there's a real possibility that he won't be taking the floor tonight. The Kings are notorious for being late with the injury updates, so Fox will be an extremely risky play in DFS. If he's out, Yogi Ferrell and Frank Mason will see an uptick in minutes."
-,"Jevon Carter recalled from the G-League: He might play if the game turns into a blowout, but he won't be on the floor in any meaningful way tonight."
!,"Anthony Davis (elbow) questionable Wednesday: Head coach Alvin Gentry said he'll be making a decision on Davis following Wednesday morning's shootaround, so owners can expect to get another update tomorrow afternoon. AD could be headed for a game-time call, but if he's out again, it'll either be Jahlil Okafor or Julius Randle getting the start, with more shots falling to Nikola Mirotic, Jrue Holiday and E'Twaun Moore. Stay tuned."
+,"Thibs wants Rose to play 26-28 mins a night: Rose has actually been surprisingly effective for the Wolves this season, posting averages of 14.8 points, 4.3 assists and just 1.0 turnover per game on 41.3% shooting from the field and 81.8% from the stripe in 28.3 minutes a night, which has been good enough for late-round value in 9-cat leagues. He won't be the difference maker on a championship team in fantasy hoops, but he's doing enough to warrant ownership in deep leagues."
!,"Andrew Wiggins (quad) questionable Wednesday: Wiggins has spent the past three games on the sidelines and the Wolves haven't provided any updates as to how close he is. Tom Thibodeau implied over the past two games that Wiggins was close, and he appeared to be on track to play on Monday after getting through shootaround without issue, but the end result was another missed game. He'll likely be a game-time call, and if he's out again, Josh Okogie will again be worth a punt in DFS."
-,"Rodions Kurucs (ankle) out Wednesday vs. DET: This will be his fifth straight game on the sidelines, and it's unclear exactly when we can expect him back. He probably won't be a major factor in the rotation while Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is healthy, so he's safe to leave on the waiver wire in all formats."
!,"Moe Harkless (knee) out Tuesday vs. Houston: Head coach Terry Stotts said earlier today that he expected Harkless to be available for tonight's game, so it's not clear if he suffered a setback after shootaround. This will be the second straight game on the sidelines for Harkless, which will translate to more minutes for Evan Turner, Jake Layman and potentially, Zach Collins. Harkless belongs on the waiver wire in all formats."
!,"Jae Crowder (ankle) probable for Wednesday: Crowder tweaked his right ankle late in Sunday's game, but it looks like he plans to power through it, given that he's being listed as probable. The Jazz need him with Derrick Favors dealing with knee issues, so there's a chance he could start on Wednesday night. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround."
-,"Derrick Favors (knee) questionable Wednesday: Favors sat out Sunday's game due to the sore knee, and it's concerning that his troublesome left knee is giving him issues this early in the year. We'll have a better idea on his status following Wendesday morning's shootaround, but if he's out again, Jae Crowder will be the primary beneficiary. Stay tuned."
-,"Alec Burks (hand) questionable for Wednesday: Burks was cleared for Sunday's game, but didn't actually step foot on the court, and that could be the same scenario that plays out on Wednesday. Leave him on the wire."
-,"Wilson Chandler (hamstring) out Tuesday: On Monday, Brett Brown said that Chandler wasn't 'that far off' from making his regular-season debut, so while he won't take the floor tonight, he does appear to be inching his way closer to his return. He's not worth stashing anywhere, but once he's back, Chandler could really hurt Dario Saric."
-,"Kevin Knox goes through non-contact work: Knox is hopeful to get back to the court by early-November, but he remains without an official timetable and the Knicks aren't in any rush to get him back. While he's out, Damyean Dotson and Mario Hezonja will pick up the majority of his minutes, and both those guys are on the radar in deep leagues. Knox wasn't playing all that well prior to going down, so he's not necessarily worth holding if you don't have an IR-spot."
-,"Chasson Randle inks deal with Washington: He'll help bring some depth to Washington's backcourt, but as the 14th man on this roster, we don't anticipate him making any noise in fantasy hoops."
!,"James Johnson (hernia) listed as out Tuesday: Johnson has been sidelined since the start of the regular season, and we haven't received any updates on his practice availability over the past two days. Hopefully, he is moving in the right direction. We should have confirmation on his status later this evening."
!,"Kelly Oubre (illness) a GTD on Tuesday: The 1-5 Wizards, who are in desperate need of win, have already ruled out Markieff Morris (concussion). If Oubre is also unable to play, they will have very little depth up front. Austin Rivers and Tomas Satoransky would likely see some time on the wing, shifting Otto Porter over to PF. Jeff Green will see plenty of playing time across the frontcourt and is worth consideration as a DFS dart throw."
!,"Markieff Morris (concussion) out Tuesday: Morris has entered the NBA's concussion protocol, meaning he will have to be cleared by league doctors before being able to return to game action. Kelly Oubre (illness) will be a game-time decision on Tuesday, which means the Wizards frontline could be extremely thin on Tuesday night. Jeff Green and Jason Smith will likely log all the minutes they can handle."
-,"Pistons will decline Ellenson's extension: Despite being a former No. 1 overall pick by the Pistons, this is not surprising. After two disappointing seasons to start his career, Ellenson has fallen out of the rotation completely in Detroit. He didn't make his season debut until the Pistons got blown out by the Celtics on Saturday."
!,Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee): Doc Rivers told reporters that he is hopeful Mbah a Moute will return Thursday in Philadelphia and said LMAM is 'right around the corner because he made the trip out.' Danilo Gallinari and Montrezl Harrell will continue to soak up extra minutes on Tuesday.
!,"OG Anunoby (personal) out again Tuesday: We don't have details as to the reason, but Anunoby has been away from the team since Friday. Hopefully, all is well. Pascal Siakam has soaked up extra minutes with OG out. Kawhi Leonard (rest) will also return for the Raps on Tuesday night."
!,"Fred VanVleet (turf toe) questionable Tuesday: VanVleet has missed each of the Raptors last three contests. However, he was able to get in a limited practice on Sunday, so appears to be headed in the right direction. If he is ruled out for Tuesday's game vs. Philly, Delon Wright will again serve as the primary backup PG behind Kyle Lowry."
!,"Iman Shumpert (rest) ruled out Tuesday: Shumpert missed the majority of the 2017-18 season but has been healthy this year, appearing in six of the Kings first seven games (four starts). Sacramento will likely continue to rest him on back-to-backs going forward. Justin Jackson and Buddy Hield should see an uptick in playing time with Shump sidelined on Tuesday."
!,"De'Aaron Fox (back) questionable for Tuesday: Per the Kings injury report, Fox strained his lower back when scoring on a layup late in the fourth quarter of Monday's victory in Miami. Fox has been playing very well this season, averaging 18.0 points (on 48.4 percent shooting(, 4.1 rebounds and 7.1 assists over his first seven games. Hopefully, this is only a minor ailment that doesn't sideline him. We can expect an update later this afternoon. If Fox is ruled out, Yogi Ferrell and Frank Mason would divvy up extended minutes at point guard."
+,"Warriors plan to pick up Damian Jones' option: Jones is making around $1.5 million this season. His salary will jump to $2.3 million for the 2019-20 season. He's been solid for Golden State thus far, averaging 6.0 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks, while shooting a league-high 77.8 percent from the floor."
-,"Daniel Theis (foot) to miss at least 2 weeks: Theis told reported he feels optimistic about his recovery: 'This one is going to be way shorter than the knee injury (that ended his rookie season).' Even when fully healthy, Theis has limited fantasy value. He should be left on waivers."
-,"Harkless (left knee) expected to play Tuesday: Harkless was forced out of Saturday's game due to knee pain and was ruled out of Monday's win over the Pacers. However, it seems to be only a minor issue, as he'll be back in the lineup on Tuesday. Nonetheless, Harkless is averaging just 3.8 points in 17.6 minutes per game this season. He should be left on waivers."
-,"Mavs assign Ray Spalding to G League: Spalding, the 56th overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft, will spend most of this season in the G-League. He is not on the fantasy radar."
+,"Elie Okobo impressing Suns coaching staff: After starting point guard Isaiah Canaan left early with a sprained left ankle in the first quarter, Okobo stepped in and stepped up. He logged a career-high 31 minutes and tallied 18 points, five rebounds, seven assists, three 3-pointers and just three turnovers. 'He played with confidence, he played with a presence. He played like, I belong here,' said Kokosov. Canaan said his ankle is 'fine,' but Okobo is a big part of the Suns future while Canaan is not. Okobo's fantasy stock is on the rise."
-,"Isaiah Canaan (ankle) says he is 'fine': Canaan tweaked the ankle in the first quarter of Sunday loss. That's the same ankle he inuured badly last season. However, he said he could've returned to Sunday's game, but the trainers didnt want to risk turning something minor into something major. 'I was like, ah naw, not again, but it was fine,' Canaan said. Nonetheless, Elie Okobo stepped in for Canaan and poured in 18 points. Okobo looks like he's the point guard to own in Phoenix."
+,"Jabari Parker plays well in loss to GSW: Parker's rolling, for the most part, and is averaging 16.6 points, 6.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.8 blocks and 1.4 3-pointers over his last five games. He'd hit five 3-pointers over his previous two games and hasn't shot it poorly from the line this season, so the negatives he provided tonight look like a fluke. He's fitting in nicely with the Bulls this season."
+,"Wendell Carter Jr. scores 18 points in loss: He's slowly getting more comfortable and his production has been trending up for a week now. This was his only game without a blocked shot, he's averaging over 3.0 assists per 36 minutes and is locked in as the starter for the entire season. Hopefully you hung onto him after his slow start, but patience is needed when you're dealing with rookies."
+,"Antonio Blakeney scores career-high 21 points: This game was over in the first quarter, so Blakeney cleaned up in garbage time with 14 points in the fourth quarter alone. He can put up points in a hurry, but we can't recommend him until he starts getting consistent run. Don't be surprised if coach Fred Hoiberg lets him loose again next game."
0,"Quinn Cook scores season-high 16 points: He also pulled down two rebounds with one assist and one triple in 17 minutes. 11 of his points came in garbage time, so we can't read too much into this line. He'll be the third-string PG once Shaun Livingston gets healthy."
+,"Tim Frazier plays 20 minutes, scores 5 points: Frazier saw a season-high 20 minutes with Elfrid Payton out. He's worth a look in deeper leagues for as long as Payton is out of the lineup."
0,"Cheick Diallo goes for 8/5 in 14 minutes: Diallo saw an uptick in minutes with Anthony Davis out and produced in limited minutes. He's buried on the depth chart, but posts solid per-minute numbers. Just something to file away."
+,"Klay Thompson scores 52 points, hits 14 treys: Remember that buy-low window we talked about when Thompson started the season shooting 5-of-36 from deep, well it just slammed shut. Thompson's 52 points is the highest scoring game of the season with Curry (51) and Blake Griffin (50) right behind. Thompson added five rebounds and one steal, and he did all of his damage in 27 minutes because of the lopsided score. That's the Klay fantasy owners know and love."
+,E'Twuan Moore scores 18 points in 38 minutes: Moore isn't the most productive Pelican but he still benefits from them playing super fast. He's scored in double-digits in five of six games and is worth owning in 12-team leagues.
-,"Ian Clark plays just six minutes on Monday: Clark was originally slated to start, but found himself back in his usual role after a late change. Frank Jackson has played well in two-straight games and might be passing Clark in the rotation. Clark isn't worth owning in any format after playing just six minutes with three rotation players out."
+,"Frank Jackson plays career-high 26 minutes: Jackson saw a huge bump in minutes with Elfrid Payton and Darius Miller out and even played ahead of Ian Clark. Jackson looks to be emerging as an option off the bench for the Pelicans, making him an interesting flier in deep-leagues."
0,"Wesley Matthews scores eight points Monday: He'd scored in double digits in all six of his games coming in and had ripped off four straight games of at least 20 points, so he was due for a letdown. He's been a very pleasant surprise up to this point of the season, so hopefully tonight wasn't a sign of things to come. He should bounce back on Wednesday against the Lakers."
-,"Jahlil Okafor starts, scores 9 in 18 minutes: Okafor got the start at center with Anthony Davis out. Julius Randle started the previous game, with Okafor coming off the bench. He's only worth a look while Davis is out."
+,"Luka Doncic (back) scores career-high 31: Well then, so much for the back injury. The comparison between Doncic and Trae Young will likely last for years, and it's already been a fun ride in their rookie seasons. Young turned heads with his 35 points and 11 assists on Oct. 21, but Doncic returned serve with tonight's gem. For the record, Doncic is averaging 18.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 0.8 steals and 2.5 3-pointers on 43 percent shooting in six games. And Trae is averaging 19.8 points, 3.4 rebounds, 6.8 assists, 0.8 steals and 2.4 3-pointers on 39 percent shooting through five games. Hopefully, Doncic's back problem is a thing of the past after this one. The best stat of the night is that Doncic became the third youngest NBA player to have at least 30 points and eight boards in a game. The other two are LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Wow."
-,Solomon Hill scores 4 points in start: Hill got the start with two starters and Darius Miller missing for the Pelicans. He didn't produce much and isn't on the fantasy radar.
0,"Thon Maker scores season-high 11 points: Coach Mike Budenholzer said Maker would get an opportunity with Giannis Antetokounmpo (concussion) out and kept his word. Instead of deploying Maker at center, he was used as a stretch four tonight, an interesting wrinkle to consider in the future if Giannis misses more time. For now, Maker is just a stash in dynasty formats, but deep-league owners can give him a look if we get bad news on the Greek Freak."
+,"Julius Randle drops 24/8/6 off the bench: Randle returned to the second unit after starting the Pelicans last game. They were still without Anthony Davis, but opted for Jahlil Okafor running with the starters in this one. Randle's per-minute production has been superb thus far and he still has value even has a sixth man."
0,"Eric Bledsoe scores 17 points in 26 minutes: He shook off a slow start tonight which was a relief to his fantasy owners, as he scored a combined 12 points in his previous two games. He finished 7-of-12 from the field, hit his only free throw and turned the ball over three times. The Bucks are 7-0 and are off to their best start in franchise history, setting up an epic showdown against Boston on Thursday. Bledsoe will have plenty of motivation for this one because of his history with Terry Rozier."
+,"Harrison Barnes looks better on Monday: This was Barnes third game of the season and the first where he looked like his old self. This was easily his best game of the three and while it's encouraging, it could still take him another few games to round into form. But if you need to get him into your lineup, it appears that he might be ready to get it going."
+,Jrue Holiday nears triple-double w/ 16/8/9: Holiday has been exceptional of late for the fast-paced Pelicans. He's contributing across the board and even has some room for improvement. Holiday looks to be over his slow start and should be a steady option moving forward.
+,"Ersan Ilyasova scores 19 in start vs. TOR: Considering he averaged 11.7 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.4 triples as a starter last season, anyone who streamed him in season-long leagues or deployed him in DFS had themselves a great night. The Bucks are off until Thursday's showdown with the Celtics, so fantasy owners can wait for an update on Giannis before picking up Ersanity."
+,"Nikola Mirotic double-doubles with 17 and 10: Mirotic continued his monster season in this one, notching his third double-double of the season. He's averaging nearly 20/10 with a handful of triples. Mirotic is enjoying life in the ultra fast-paced Pelicans lineup and looks like a draft day steal."
-,"Delon Wright (groin) plays 13 minutes: Even with Fred VanVleet (toe) out, the Raptors eased Wright back into action tonight. His minutes could be on the rise soon, but Wright is more of a deep-league asset because Danny Green is having a terrific season."
-,"Norman Powell scores eight points: He had seven points with five rebounds and one 3-pointer in his last start for Kawhi, so he's going to be even harder to trust the next time Kawhi sits. Powell belongs on the waiver wire."
+,"Trey Lyles scores season-high 17 points: Lyles had his best game of the season on Monday. He's been playing most back-up four, but does see some time at the three. With Will Barton out, he'll continue to see playing time, making him an option in deeper leagues."
+,"Josh Okogie scores 17 in start for Wiggins: That makes three straight missed games for Wiggins, and three solid games from Okogie in his last four. The 17 points were a season high, as were the 30 minutes, but Wiggins was close to playing tonight. Once he's back from his quad injury, Okogie should take a backseat to Wiggins and Derrick Rose. But given Rose's injury history, it could just take an injury to Rose to thrust Okogie back into the spotlight. Just keep an eye on him, or feel free to use him in DFS if Wiggins is going to miss any more games."
+,"Pascal Siakam breaks out w/ 22 points: He has now started six out of seven games for the Raptors, but didn't make much noise until his last two games. In that span, he's averaging 16.0 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 2.5 steals in 35.0 minutes. He's benefitted from OG Anunoby missing two games for personal reasons and Kawhi Leonard resting tonight, but Siakam is trending up as a pickup in standard leagues for his multi-category upside."
+,"Jimmy Butler bounces back with season-high 32: JB hit just 2-of-11 shots for four points in 24 minutes on Friday, when he was dealing with an illness, but looked like a different guy tonight. We still have no idea how things will end up between Butler and the Wolves, but as long as he's there and playing, he should be in your lineup. He hit the game-sealing dagger against the Lakers tonight, as Jimmy is apt to do."
0,"Malik Beasley plays season-high 31 minutes: Beasley played a critical role in the Nuggets win and played much more than starter Torrey Craig. With Will Barton out for the foreseeable future, Beasley has a chance to grab hold of some playing time. He's not worth an add just yet, but keep an eye on him in deeper leagues."
0,"Karl-Anthony Towns has breakout game vs. LA: To be fair, the steal and four blocks tied season highs, but none the less, this was the first WOW line of KAT's young season. He managed to do it with Jimmy Butler in the lineup (and going off), and we can only hope that this is start of a big run for KAT. He hasn't really been bad this season, but for a guy who went Top 5 in almost every fantasy league, he's been a little quiet for most of his owner's liking. He does have a tough test on Halloween night though, as the Timberwolves will visit Rudy Gobert and the defensive-minded Jazz."
+,"Serge Ibaka goes off for 30 points vs. MIL: He got off to a blistering start with 13 points in the first quarter, finishing 12-of-21 from the field and 4-of-4 from the line. He was one point shy of his career-high, taking on an expanded role on offense with Kawhi Leonard resting. Even though he's basically rotating in and out of the starting lineup with Jonas Valanciunas, Ibaka does look rejuvenated this season and is flirting with mid-round value. Expect him to come off the bench on Tuesday with Joel Embiid up next."
0,"Josh Hart scores 5 off bench in 24 minutes: Owners of Hart and Lonzo Ball are not feeling the return of Ingram and Rajon Rondo right now, but patience is in order here. Hart's simply too good to keep off the floor for the Lakers, but he could be in for a quiet week or two as Luke Walton tries to figure out the best way to manage his stable of wings going forward."
+,"Paul Millsap scores season-high 18 in win: Millsap has been inconsistent in the points column, but has been a steady contributor in the rebounding department. His contributions in the defensive area of the game is a big reason why he's still a valuable asset. Millsap won't be posting nightly double-doubles like he once did, but he's still very helpful."
+,Gary Harris drops 23/6/6 in Monday's win: Harris' two steals came in crucial late possessions and effectively sealed the win for the Nuggets. He's an incredibly important player on both ends and has picked up some action without Will Barton. Harris is a very steady fantasy contributor.
-,"Lonzo Ball awful in loss to Wolves: He didn't play well and wasn't really even involved in the proceedings, while Rajon Rondo came off the bench for 13 points, six boards, eight assists and a 3-pointer on 6-of-9 shooting. Ball just got the job over Rondo while Rondo was out on suspension, but this wasn't a great showing, and his minutes have been dropping. Yeah, Ball's starting, but Rondo's getting the minutes right now, at least until Ball starts producing with the first unit. Just hang in there as the Lakers and Ball work through some growing pains."
+,"Nikola Jokic nears triple-double w/ 12/9/10: Jokic was one rebound away from his second triple-double of the season. He played more of a facilitator role tonight, only attempting eight shots and racking up 10 assists. We didn't get to see him go up against Anthony Davis, but Jokic still showed why he's a top-ten fantasy player."
0,"Jamal Murray swipes career-high 5 steals: Murray was active on the defensive end in this one, registering five steals and one block. He has yet to catch fire from deep, but is still finding ways to produce. The leg soreness appears to be a thing of the pass, setting up Murray to play a season-high 39 minutes. The minutes and shots are their for him, he just needs to get in a groove."
+,"Welcome back: Ingram scores 24 in return: His four-game suspension is over and Ingram celebrated with season highs in points, rebounds, assists, blocks, 3-pointers, field goal attempts, shots made and free throws made. He's going to be playing a lot of shooting guard as long as LeBron James, Kyle Kuzma and JaVale McGee are all starting for the Lakers, but he can handle it."
+,"Tim Hardaway Jr. scores 25 points vs. Nets: He took an elbow to the face and went back to the locker room in the second quarter, but later returned for the second half and obviously fared well. He matched his career-high in assists with eight and added five rebounds, one steal and three triples in 35 minutes. THJ will continue to run more offense if Frank Ntilikina keeps starting at point guard, so his fantasy arrow is pointing up. Hopefully they don't mess with his minutes like they're doing with Enes Kanter."
+,"LeBron James' monster line not enough vs. MIN: He had a big game, but it wasn't enough to keep his Lakers from dropping to 2-5 on the season. LeBron's going to have to carry a heavy load this season to keep the Lakers afloat, but if they ever fall out of the playoff hunt, he' going to be a serious shutdown candidate. Hopefully, he'll play well enough not to let that happen."
+,"Enes Kanter double-doubles off bench: He's not happy about coming off the bench and made that known, but coach David Fizdale said Kanter responded with a great practice over the weekend and it obviously carried over into this game. Kanter may have some ups and downs with the Knicks trying to get young guys like Mitchell Robinson and Noah Vonleh more involved, but he only needs minutes in the mid-20s to return mid-round value."
0,"Kyle Kuzma starts, scores 19 points in loss: This wasn't his best game of the season, by far, but he was effective and got to keep his starting job, while Josh Hart was sent back to the bench with the return of Brandon Ingram. While the Lakers lineup is still a bit fluid, Kuzma has played well enough to command a starting job until further notice."
-,"Emmanuel Mudiay plays two minutes: Coach David Fizdale believes Mudiay is 'the best passer' on the Knicks and he may get some starts down the road with the franchise in player-evaluation mode (tanking), but he's not someone to consider in fantasy leagues."
+,"Frank Ntilikina scores 16 points vs. Nets: Not only was he good offensively, but he also shut down a red-hot Caris LeVert and held him to four points on 11 shots. Ntilikina started at point guard again and was aggressive early, something that coach David Fizdale keeps encouraging. He had a career-high 17 points with one rebound, two assists, one steal and three 3-pointers in 26 minutes in his previous start vs. the Warriors, so PG-needy owners should consider grabbing him now if you're OK with his volatile FG%."
+,"Josh Richardson scores career-high 31 in loss: The zero dimes were weird, but he more than made up with it with the steals, blocks and 3-pointers, not too mention the points. He might have been on some benches with the Heat playing just three times this week, but hopefully yours wasn't one of them. J-Rich has been alternating good games with mediocre ones lately, but hopefully this is the start of a trend in the right direction. He's on track to have a big season."
+,"Mitchell Robinson scores 11 points Monday: He had three fouls and played just 15 minutes, but he had a couple head-turning plays including a ridiculous display of athleticism on a steal that led to a breakaway dunk (link below). Knicks coach David Fizdale has already shown a willingness to ride his young guys with his team off to a 2-5 start, so it might not be long before Robinson becomes relevant in standard leagues for his blocks upside."
+,"Whiteside goes ballistic with 16-24-5 line: He was one board shy of tying his career high, but easily set a season high with the boards tonight. His scoring and production is usually pretty touch and go, but he's hit double digits in rebounds in all five games this season, and has racked up 11 blocks over his last two games. Whiteside and Willie Cauley-Stein put on a show against each other tonight, but the Kings got the last laugh."
0,"Rodney McGruder cools off in loss to Kings: McGruder had scored between 14 and 20 points in each of his last four games, and has been filling up the stat sheet since day one. This was his first game without either a block or a steal, but at least he kept his 3-point streak alive at six games this season. He's been picked up in almost all fantasy leagues and while this was a terrible way to start out Week 3, he should bounce back against the Hornets on Tuesday."
+,"Spencer Dinwiddie scores 17 points vs. NYK: He was 6-of-10 from the field and 3-of-3 from the line with one turnover. Even with D'Angelo Russell and Caris LeVert off to a hot start, Dinwiddie is still getting minutes in the mid-20s consistently and will do just enough to warrant ownership in standard leagues."
0,"Marvin Bagley plays just 17 minutes in win: Nemanja Bjelica, Willie Cauley-Stein, De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield were all on fire tonight, and have been playing well for most of the season, leaving Bagley on the bench to pick up scrap minutes where he can find them. It also doesn't help that the Kings have somehow won four of their last five games and three straight, making them a surprising 4-3 on the season. Until Bjelica cools down, it's going to be slow rolling with Bagley. Cut him if you must, but we recommend keeping him stashed until it's his time to shine for the Kings."
+,"Trae Young nears double-double w/11 & 8 dimes: Young couldn't get his shots to fall from deep in this one, but still dished out eight assists. His usage rate remains high on the fast-paced Hawks, making him a solid fantasy option, even though he's inefficient. Don't let the bad nights get you down."
+,"Buddy Hield has big night in another Kings W: The points and block also tied season highs, and Hield is on cruise control right now. Hopefully you have him in your lineup for all four games this week. Maybe he'll take a hit once Bogdan Bogdanovic returns from his knee injury, but Hield's playing well enough that it may not matter."
-,"Vince Carter scores 4 points in 20 minutes: Carter is still starting in a small-ball four role for the Hawks, but is helping them more outside of the stat sheet. The veteran is only a punt play in DFS."
-,"Omari Spellman scores 11, grabs 6 boards: Spellman is seeing playing time with John Collins still out with an injury. The rookie is a deep-league streamer for now."
0,"Caris LeVert posts first dud of the season: Credit to Frank Ntilikina for playing some impressive defense on one of the hottest players in the East. Entering tonight's game, LeVert was one of nine players averaging 20+ points, 4+ rebounds and 4+ assists while shooting over 50 percent from the field, so his fantasy owners should cut him some slack. He salvaged his night with five assists, two steals and two rebounds, and he'll look to bounce back vs. the Pistons on Wednesday."
-,"Alex Len plays only 15 minutes on Monday: Len has seen his minutes take a big hit with the return of Dewayne Dedmon. He still got the start against the Sixers, but that might not last for much longer. Len can't be counted on right now."
-,"Iman Shumpert quiet in another start: He was starting to catch fire before missing a game with a hip injury, but his last two outings have been nothing to write home about. If you picked him up for his four-game week and the hopes of steals, blocks and 3-pointers, the good news is that he still has three games to proves his worth. It's possible that his two big games before his injury were just a fluke, but if he's going to prove otherwise, we hope he does so in a hurry. It's also worth noting that the other four Kings starters all had one of their best games of the season on Monday, meaning Shump was the odd man out on this night."
+,"Willie Cauley-Stein blows up for huge line: Those were season highs in points and boards, and were in the ballpark of his career highs, as well. WCS has quietly double-doubled in his last three games, has scored in double digits in all seven of his games this season, and managed to pick up his first block since opening night on Monday. He's getting hot, and not coincidentally, the Kings have now won four of their last five games and three straight."
+,"Victor Oladipo scores 21 points in loss: He hit his only free throw and finished 9-of-24 from the field. Oladipo is on pace for a career-high in usage rate (30.2) and has now scored 20+ points in each of his last six games since his quiet opener. He did have a collision with Jusuf Nurkic and took a shoulder to his chin, and while he looked a bit dazed initially, he seemed fine after a couple minutes."
+,"Taurean Prince struggles, makes only one FG: Prince had been really good up until this one, but the defense of Robert Covington and the Sixers got the best of him. He's a huge part of the Hawks offense, but might lose some 4th quarter time in blowouts like this one. There's no reason to be worried, though, as Prince is well on his way to crushing his draft day position."
+,"Nemanja Bjelica stays hot in win over Heat: It's becoming a broken record around here, but Bjelica continues to produce, while Marvin Bagley played just 17 minutes tonight. Until Bjelica's minutes start trending in the wrong direction, he should be owned in all fantasy leagues until further notice. Over his last five, he's averaging 15.6 points, 7.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.2 blocks and 2.6 3-pointers on 57 percent shooting with just 1.4 turnovers per game. If you picked him up early, he's already been a game changer for you in fantasy."
+,"Darren Collison scores 17 w/ six assists: He also played a season-high 36 minutes even with Tyreke Evans back from his suspension, hitting 8-of-14 shots and finishing without a turnover. This was his second strong game in a row after a painfully slow start, so optimistic owners will be hoping that he has returned to his mid-round ways like he showcased last season."
0,"Kent Bazemore scores 18 points on Monday: Bazemore contributed across the stat sheet in Monday's loss. He's been inconsistent, but still provides a source of steals and threes that makes him attractive in deeper leagues."
+,"J.J. Redick ties career-high with 8 rebounds: Redick wasn't making a lot of his shots, but still found a way to contribute. He's had 3+ assists in four of the team's seven games now and matched a career-high with eight rebounds. Redick will be a great source of triples moving forward, as usual."
+,"Mike Muscala hits 4 triples, scores 14 points: The 19 minutes were good for a season-high for Muscala and he earned them, knocking down a season-high four triples. The Sixers brought Moose in to help the bench and replicate the late-season production from Ersan Ilyasova. More nights like this will have him approaching the fantasy radar."
-,"Tyreke Evans struggles in return: He was a -22 during his time on the floor and the entire second unit didn't show up for Indiana -- Portland's bench outscored Indiana 54-15. Evans picked the wrong time to miss practice, as Darren Collison has found his rhythm again and might be closing more games over Evans going forward. He'll try to get back on track in a favorable matchup vs. the Knicks on Wednesday."
0,"Dario Saric's early-season struggles continue: Saric has been struggling and had his worst night of the season on Monday. Even though the shots aren't falling, he hasn't been lacking the confidence to attempt them. The Homie has also been active on the glass every night. The coaches don't seem worried, so you shouldn't be either. His 3-point percentage increased every month last season, which means it's not time to give up."
-,"Myles Turner scores 10 points vs. Blazers: He was 5-of-12 from the field, but his blocks made up for the quiet night on the offensive end. The good news is that Turner logged seven minutes next to Domantas Sabonis, but the bad news is that that lineup got shredded -- they had a -33.8 net rating. Unless that combo is used more often, Turner's floor won't be as high on the nights when Sabonis has the hot hand."
0,"Markelle Fultz scores career-high 16 points: Fultz took a career-high 16 shots and made a career-high 7 of them. He wasn't particularly aggressive in the first half, but showed a lot more fire in the second half. It's clear that Fultz struggles when playing with Ben Simmons (or T.J. McConnell), which is partly why he was more assertive in the second half and something the Sixers will need to figure out. The seven assists matched a season-high, as well as the one triple made. Fultz is maddeningly inconsistent, but still has obvious upside."
0,"Al-Farouq Aminu double-doubles vs. IND: That's his second double-double of the season and he might have a few more minutes coming his way with Moe Harkless (knee) on the shelf again. He's not loaded with upside by any means and was averaging 7.4 points, 8.8 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 1.0 triples entering tonight's game on 34.3% shooting, but he might have some sneaky value this week with the Blazers playing four more times."
0,"Caleb Swanigan double-doubles vs. Pacers: He played three minutes on the season entering tonight's game, so this truly came out of nowhere. The Pacers used some traditional lineups with Myles Turner getting run next to Domantas Sabonis, so Portland was able to play four bigs. Swanigan gave coach Terry Stotts something to think about tonight, but we'll need to see it again before recommending him outside of very deep leagues."
0,"Joel Embiid scores season-low 10 points: Embiid attempted a season-low nine shots, which was a by-product of the Hawks doubling him almost every time he touched the ball. Tonight also snapped his six game double-double streak to open the season. The Sixers were up big in the fourth, which led to most of the Sixers rotation players sitting because it's the first night of a back-to-back set (related: there's been no talk of JoJo sitting tomorrow). Still, Embiid posted six assists and will be an elite fantasy option whenever he plays, even if he has an off night from the field."
+,"Zach Collins stays hot w/ 17 points in win: Collins also hit both of his free throws, adding three rebounds, three assists, one block and one triple in 27 minutes. He took advantage of some early foul trouble by Jusuf Nurkic (two in the first couple minutes), and finished with a +22 during his time on the court. Collins continues to make a case for more playing time and already has mid-round value in category leagues despite coming off the bench, so he has to be owned right now with four more games on the schedule for Portland this week."
+,"Ben Simmons posts 21/12/9 in just 27 minutes: Simmons went off in the third quarter, scoring 15 of his season-high 21 in that frame. He also rebounded from his season-low assist total last time out, dishing nine assists tonight. Simmons has been inconsistent from the free throw line, shooting just 56% on the season, but went 5-of-5 tonight. We know he's going to post a near triple-double every night, but if he can get his FT% above 70%, he'll be even more valuable."
-,"Jusuf Nurkic plays just 18 minutes vs. IND: This was his second dud in a row after scoring five points vs. the Heat on Saturday. Nurkic got a quick hook  in the first quarter with a pair of fouls, and then he lost minutes to a red-hot Zach Collins off the bench (17 points in 27 minutes). Collins is becoming more and more of a threat to Nurkic, but his owners just have to hope that he can turn things around. Luckily, Portland plays four more times this week."
!,"Update: Ian Clark off the bench: Coach Alvin Gentry said Clark was going to start for Elfrid Payton (ankle), but changed his mind before tip-off. Instead, Solomon Hill will entering the starting lineup."
-,Davis Bertans will come off the bench: It's becoming obvious that San Antonio's lineups are going to be fluid going forward. Dante Cunningham will start but he has no fantasy value.
-,"Delon Wright (groin) is active Monday: He's had this injury for a while and the Raptors may monitor his minutes. Even with Fred VanVleet (toe) out, Wright is a shaky play until he proves he's 100 percent."
!,"Fred VanVleet (turf toe) ruled out Monday: The Raptors waited until five minutes before tip-off to rule FVV out, and they also changed their starting lineup three times in the span of an hour. Delon Wright is active tonight and will handle the backup PG duties as long as he's healthy."
0,"Julius Randle will come off the bench Monday: Randle got the start on Saturday with Anthony Davis (elbow) unavailable, but head coach Alvin Gentry will be going with a more traditional lineup today, running Jahlil Okafor at center. Randle should still see ample minutes with Davis watching from the sidelines, and he's actually been better as a reserve this season, so this isn't necessarily a bad thing."
0,Ian Clark starting for Elfrid Payton (ankle): Clark will be in there to space the floor but Jrue Holiday is going to run the show on offense. Clark is more of a deep-league streamer with some boom-or-bust appeal.
-,"Okafor starting for Anthony Davis (elbow): The Pelicans are wanting some size for the matchup vs. Nikola Jokic, so Julius Randle will go back to his bench role. You would have to be desperate to pick up Okafor, especially since Davis is day-to-day."
0,"Luka Doncic (sore back) will play Monday: Doncic will be watched closely, so DFS players should keep that in mind. We'll have an update on how he fares after the game."
!,"Livingston (foot) expects to miss a few games: Livingston tweaked his foot during the Dubs' final preseason game, and unfortunately, it's become a nagging issue. While he doesn't think it's all that serious, he could get another MRI, and it sounds like he'll be taking the next handful of games off. Quinn Cook will serve as Stephen Curry's primary backup while Livingston is out."
0,"Kyle Kuzma listed in the starting lineup Mon: Brandon Ingram is back from his four-game suspension, but it looks like he'll be starting at the two with Josh Hart moving back to the second unit. Joining Kuzma and Ingram in the starting five will be Lonzo Ball, LeBron James and JaVale McGee."
+,"Josh Hart will come off the bench: The Lakers will start Brandon Ingram at shooting guard with Kyle Kuzma at power forward, but we still like Hart's chances of playing nearly 30 minutes. He's simply playing too well not to. His fantasy owners shouldn't panic."
0,"Carlisle expects Luka Doncic to play: Dallas will monitor him up until tip-off, but barring a setback, he will be out there in his usual role. This makes him risky in DFS, but season-long owners can throw him into lineups."
!,"Update: Andrew Wiggins (quad) out Monday: Wiggins was able to get through shootaround without issue, so maybe he tweaked something while going through his pregame routine. Unfortunately, he'll miss his third game in a row tonight, which will allow Josh Okogie to get another start, but he's been hit-or-miss with the starting unit. For now, we'll be considering Wiggins questionable for Wednesday's game against the Jazz."
-,"Thon Maker to see some action Monday: Maker is the third center on the depth chart behind Brook Lopez and John Henson, but coach Mike Budenholzer said Maker may get an opportunity with Giannis Antetokounmpo (concussion) out. You still can't trust him in almost any fantasy league, though."
-,"Anfernee Simons will be available to play Mon: Simons hasn't been able to get into the rotation this season, but that could change tonight with Moe Harkless (knee) watching from the sidelines. We don't expect him to get enough minutes to make an impact in fantasy hoops, though."
-,"Norman Powell starting for Kawhi Leonard: Leonard will be back on Tuesday to take on the 76ers, so Powell is just a desperation streamer or a punt option in DFS. He wasn't effective in his last spot-start, scoring seven points with five rebounds and one 3-pointer."
-,"Michael Beasley (personal) ruled out Monday: He's not a part of the rotation anyway, so his playing status is irrelevant in fantasy hoops."
-,"Andre Iguodala (calf) available to play: Iguodala will be available, but the Dubs may monitor his minutes tonight with it being the second game of a back-to-back set. He's not worth owning anywhere."
0,"Tyreke Evans will play Monday vs. Portland: Evans was given a one-game suspension for showing up late to a recent practice, but he's done his time and both sides look ready to move on. Feel free to get him active for an uptempo matchup against Portland."
0,"Andrew Wiggins (quad) on track to play Monday: Head coach Tom Thibodeau said that Wiggins got through shootaround without any issues, so barring a setback during his pregame routine, he'll be back in action tonight following a two-game stint on the sidelines. With Wiggins back, Josh Okogie will return to the second unit, and he'll lose most his value with the demotion."
0,"Luc Mbah a Moute (knee) questionable Tuesday: Mbah a Moute has missed the past two games with the knee issue, but we'll have a better idea on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround. If he's out again, Danilo Gallinari and Montrezl Harrell will split his minutes."
-,"James Ennis (hamstring) out Tuesday vs. POR: The Rockets initially said that Ennis would miss at least two games with a Grade 2 hamstring strain, which severely undershot the mark. He could be out a few weeks with this injury, which will result in more minutes for Carmelo Anthony and Gerald Green with Melo getting the start. Ennis shouldn't be owned anywhere, and it's not clear when he'll be back."
+,"Mitchell Robinson will start again on Monday: David Fizdale will go with the same starting five from last Friday featuring Frank Ntilikina, Damyean Dotson, Tim Hardaway Jr., Noah Vonleh and Robinson with Enes Kanter coming off the bench. That starting group did play fairly well through the first three quarters of action against the defending champs, and Fizdale said he thought that lengthy lineup helped his team on defense. Mitchell sticking with the starting group is an excellent sign regarding his long-term outlook, so he's on the radar as a potential speculative add in deep leagues."
-,"Delon Wright (groin) probable for Monday: Considering Wright tweaked his groin in his first game of the season on Wednesday, the Raptors will likely be taking it easy on him as he works his way back into the rotation. Even when he's 100% healthy, it's tough to see him as anything more than a low-end guy in deep leagues. For now, he can remain on the waiver wire."
-,"Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle) available to play: Mudiay will likely be making his regular-season debut tonight, but we'd expect his minutes to be held in check in his first game of the season. Head coach David Fizdale did say that he may start Mudiay at some point, but for now, he's safe to leave on the wire in all leagues."
0,"Brown says Wilson Chandler 'not that far off': To be clear, Chandler will miss Monday's game against the Hawks, but he does appear to be trending in the right direction. This is great news for Chandler after Brown said a couple weeks ago that he was still 'a ways away,' so maybe he'll be able to get back at some point during this five-game week for Philly. It's unlikely he'll have much value in fantasy hoops this season, but having him in the rotation could hurt Dario Saric."
-,"Sindarius Thornwell headed for G-League stint: The Clippers have a ton of depth in their backcourt, so it would take a string of injuries for Thornwell to emerge as a rotation player in Los Angeles. Leave him on the wire."
-,"Dillon Brooks (foot) probable for Tuesday: Brooks has been dealing with this foot issue since the season opener, but so far, he's only missed one game. In Memphis, probable tends to mean 'will play,' and we should get official confirmation on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround. He's not a fantasy factor, though."
!,"Steven Adams (calf) questionable for Tuesday: Adams was a late scratch on Sunday with the calf issue, which resulted in Nerlens Noel drawing the start, but Noel tweaked his ankle on Sunday and is now also questionable for Tuesday's game. If both these guys are out, Jerami Grant may see playing time in the 40s. We'll have a better idea on Adams' status following Tuesday morning's shootaround."
!,"Nerlens Noel, Adams questionable for Tuesday: Noel tweaked his ankle during the fourth quarter of Sunday's win over the Suns, and if both him and Adams are out on Tuesday, OKC may be forced to start Patrick Patterson and Jerami Grant in their frontcourt. Check back for another update following Tuesday morning's shootaround."
!,James Harden unlikely to return before Friday: Harden is scheduled to be re-evaluated on Thursday before the Rockets leave for a five-game road trip. Coach Mike D'Antoni said Harden is 'making good progress' and he left the door open for him to return as soon as Saturday's game vs. Chicago on the second night of a back-to-back. Owners who have to submit weekly lineups should look at other options.
0,76ers pick up Ben Simmons' option: They also exercised the third-year options on Markelle Fultz and Dario Saric. This is just a formality and a no-brainer for the front office.
-,"Andre Iguodala (calf tightness) is probable: It's the second night of a back-to-back and Iggy has been banged up, so maybe the Warriors limit his minutes tonight. He's not a standard-league option and has been very underwhelming this season."
0,"Brandon Ingram says he will start Monday: He's been suspended for the past four games after his altercation with the Rockets. Ingram said he didn't know the starting lineup, but made it clear that he was going to be in the first unit. This means Kyle Kuzma or Josh Hart will head back to the bench, but we'll have to wait until closer to tip-off before we know for sure."
-,"Aron Baynes (hamstring) could return Tuesday: This is great news for Boston because they just learned that Daniel Theis (foot) is out indefinitely. If Baynes is cleared, he'll slot right back in as the backup center, but there's not much fantasy appeal. If he's not able to play, the Celtics might give Robert Williams a chance. The Celtics will list Baynes as probable."
-,"Theis has a slight tear of the plantar fascia: That's the bad news. The good news is that Theis won't need surgery and he'll be re-evaluated in a couple weeks. Coach Brad Stevens said he was relieved that the diagnosis wasn't worse, but it's safe to assume the Celtics won't rush him back. Marcus Morris will continue to see a bump in minutes off the bench, and with Aron Baynes (hamstring) still hurt, maybe the Celtics give Robert Williams an opportunity."
!,"Darius Miller (right quad) ruled out: He was originally listed as doubtful, so no surprise here. Wes Johnson and Solomon Hill will pick up some minutes, but there isn't a clear fantasy pickup."
!,"Anthony Davis (elbow) ruled out again: This comes from a report from Yahoo's Chris Haynes, so we don't have comments from coach Alvin Gentry or Davis yet. This is the second game in a row on the sidelines for Davis, but the fact that he's been initially labeled as questionable suggests that he's day-to-day. Nikola Mirotic and Jrue Holiday will get a lot more touches on offense, and Julius Randle will look to bounce back after getting in foul trouble vs. Rudy Gobert in his last game."
-,"Rodions Kurucs (ankle) out Monday: He has made a strong impression, but minutes won't be easy to find now that Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is back."
-,Devin Harris (hamstring) out again Monday: He has no timetable for a return and may not be in the rotation when he comes back.
-,Kosta Koufos (hamstring strain) is probable: Koufos isn't in Sacramento's plans right now and probably won't play if he's cleared.
+,"Ersan Ilyasova to start for Giannis on Monday: Concussions are tricky because their timetables are all over the place, but Ilyasova is a nice streaming option in the short term. In 43 starts last season, he put up 11.7 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.4 triples. The rest of the Bucks' starting lineup will benefit as well, as Giannis leads the NBA in usage rate."
!,"Markieff Morris questionable for Tuesday: The Wizards will evaluate him soon to determine whether or not he will be placed in the concussion protocol. The Wizards are dropping like flies and very little frontcourt depth right now. Kelly Oubre looks like the big winner if Morris sits, as he's been logging a ton of minutes in small-ball lineups. Jeff Green also benefits as well."
!,"Antetokounmpo (concussion) ruled out Monday: The Raptors may have anticipated this because they have already decided to rest Kawhi Leonard. Giannis said he blacked out on Saturday when he took an elbow to the head, so it's hard to believe the Bucks let him return to that one. The entire starting lineup gets a bump with Giannis' league-leading usage rate out of the picture, and we could see more of Donte DiVincenzo, Tony Snell and Ersan Ilyasova."
!,"Luka Doncic (back) listed as questionable: The Mavs are calling it lower back soreness. Doncic also banged his knee on Sunday night and this is the second game of a back-to-back, so maybe they play it safe and hold him out. If Luka can't go, Dennis Smith Jr. and J.J. Barea will get a bump in usage, while Maxi Kleber could be more involved as well."
!,"OG Anunoby (personal) ruled out Monday: He was expected to return tonight, but Kawhi Leonard (rest) was also expected to play. Siakam played a season-high 37 minutes with OG out of the lineup on Friday, scoring 10 points with seven rebounds, three assists and one steal."
!,"Andrew Wiggins (quad) is a game-time call: Wiggins has missed two games in a row, but he's had the entire weekend off to get right. The Wolves will make a decision after warmups, but if he can't go, Josh Okogie could get another start and Derrick Rose will get a nice bump in value off the bench."
-,"Kawhi Leonard will rest on Monday vs. MIL: Welp. Coach Nick Nurse said on Sunday that there was 'no plan' to sit Leonard, but Leonard's camp may be calling the shots here. This is the second game that Kawhi will miss and his fantasy owners are just hoping that this doesn't become a trend. He'll be back in the lineup on Tuesday vs. Toronto. With OG Anunoby (personal) out again, Pascal Siakam looks like a nice option after playing 37 minutes in his last game. Kyle Lowry and Danny Green also get a bump."
0,"Brown not worried about Dario Saric: 'I dont think its anything to do with the league scouting him differently,' Brown said. 'I think it maybe does have to do with a little bit of burnt energy. Its the toil of a summer (Saric spent the summer with the Croatian national team). This notion, that you play 12 months and youre really in a good flow, is a myth. It is a myth. People need rest.' Saric is shooting 38.2% from the field and 27% from deep this season, but it's just a matter of time before he heats up and Philly plays five times this week."
0,"Wolves demanding Eric Gordon in Butler talks: We already know Houston has offered up to four first-round picks, but that offer didn't include Gordon. Butler is one of the best two-way players in the league and the Rockets are all-in on their pursuit of a championship, but it sounds like the talks have stalled once again."
0,"Jaylen Brown frustrated with slow start: 'Its been a little frustrating,' Brown said. 'At the end of the day, youve got to make plays and hit shots. Im trying to find a rhythm, trying to take the right shots. Thats what Im looking for.' He finally came alive for 19 points with two rebounds, one assist, one steal, one block and three 3-pointers in 25 minutes on Saturday, so hopefully that is a sign of things to come. Coach Brad Stevens hasn't lost confidence in Brown and believes he's been playing with 'unbelievable energy,' so it will be interesting to see if he can build off that performance on Tuesday vs. Detroit."
-,"Wilson Chandler (hamstring) out Monday: Chandler did not meet his initial target date and is progressing slower than expected.  Coach Brett Brown said that Chandler is still 'a ways away' when asked last week, so we see no reason to stash him in most leagues."
0,"Fizdale: Kanter responded well to benching: 'He sees himself as a starter too and I understand that,' Fizdale said. 'Im looking for combinations. He had a great practice today. He came to work. Brought good energy, was great in the film.' We were worried about Kanter because he's on an expiring contract on a tanking team, and Fizdale wants to take an extended look at Noah Vonleh and Mitchell Robinson. Kanter is still an excellent per-minute fantasy contributor and could have mid-round value if he plays minutes in the mid-20s. Whether or not this move to the bench is permanent remains to be seen, but Kanter's owners shouldn't panic."
0,"D'Angelo Russell thinks he complements LeVert: 'I think we both are able to play off the ball. Were both able to create. We just flow. Weve got a chemistry thats connecting well together,' Russell said. 'I think the next step is getting other guys involved at the same time and finishing games.' They combined for 48 points and 13 assists against the Warriors on Sunday, and coach Kenny Atkinson said he likes their chemistry as well. Russell is heating up after a slow start with 23.3 points, 6.0 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 4.3 triples over his last three games."
-,"Tyler Johnson's rotation spot in jeopardy?: Goran Dragic, Rodney McGruder and Josh Richardson are all guaranteed big minutes right now, and Johnson is shooting 35.9% from the field and 3 of 18 on 3-pointers this season. Wayne Ellington will make his season debut any day now, and the Heat haven't even gotten Dion Waiters (ankle) or James Johnson (hernia) back yet. Johnson is an easy drop candidate."
-,"Woj: Kevin Love could miss more than a month: Woj adds that the 'intense pain and the combination of an 0-6 start make it less logical for Love to push through the injury.' Love will consult with doctors early this week, but his fantasy owners should be prepared for a lengthy absence. At this point, Love's owners should be rooting for a trade so he can salvage this season later in the campaign -- the shut-down risk is extremely high on the tanking Cavs. Larry Nance should be owned everywhere, while Cedi Osman will try to get going after a tough week."
0,"John Wall shoots 8-of-20, Wizards now 1-5: Wall didn't make a 3-pointer and the silver lining is that he racked up steals while committing just one turnover in 28 minutes. Prior to the game, Wizards head coach Scott Brooks emphasized defense as the key, but they lost 136-104 in L.A. tonight with the Clippers shooting 54.4% as a team. The Wizards are unintentionally tanking but it's safe to assume that Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter will continue to check the necessary boxes for fantasy owners."
0,"Boban Marjanovic plays well...in 12 minutes: The 7'3' center made only 1-of-4 free throws, but he sank 6-of-7 field goals for his first double-digit scoring performance since Oct. 19. The lopsided score tonight obscures any takeaways from Boban's activity, especially since he played a combined 10 minutes in L.A.'s previous three games. He's more of a handcuff for Montrezl Harrell and Marcin Gortat in deep leagues."
0,"Lou Williams scores 17 points in 16 minutes: Williams also dished out six assists with one steal and only one 3-pointer. That efficiency is key to his fantasy appeal, and his 28.6% usage is comparable to last year's 29.8%, when he unexpectedly dropped top-50 roto value. The Clippers' backcourt is deeper this season and Sweet Lou's owners should be relieved that they have a 4-2 record -- if they stay in the mix for a playoff spot, the odds of tanking decrease dramatically."
-,"Markieff Morris (flu) scoreless in 14 minutes: Morris was a game-time decision and fantasy owners probably wish he'd sat it out. He missed all four of his field goal attempts, grabbed one rebound, and did nothing else statistically. The Wizards' road trip continues in Memphis on Tuesday and we expect 'Kieff to fare better vs. rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. in that game."
-,"Montrezl Harrell cools off Sunday in 16 mins: Boban Marjanovic has been used situationally and starter Marcin Gortat is averaging a mere 17.0 minutes, partly due to Harrell's effective play off the bench. Harrell shot just 1-of-4 from the line tonight, however, and the center minutes were spread evenly between himself, Gortat (20) and Marjanovic (12). He's a great DFS play until the price increases, but season-long owners can't really trust him as more than a FG% specialist."
-,"Milos Teodosic aids Clips to 2nd straight win: The veteran attempted only one shot, a made 3-pointer, and he's still far off the fantasy map. Doc Rivers has been going small with Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) out of commission, and the Clippers have won two straight, so there's at least some daylight in very deep leagues."
-,"Kelly Oubre shoots 2-of-12 in loss vs. Clips: Oubre made 4-of-4 free throws but just 1-of-7 shots from deep, and his inefficiency can't bode well with teammate Bradley Beal, who said prior to the game, 'We suck right now.' The Wizards are 1-5 and the silver lining for fantasy owners is that they're unlikely to tank with a massive payroll."
+,"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander goes 10-8-7-2 Sunday: SGA just keeps plugging away and tonight's line featured career highs in rebounds and assists, and he tied his career highs with the 3-pointer and two steals. He's trending up and while it might take an injury to Patrick Beverley to finally set him free, there's plenty of intrigue with SGA. He's not a must-own player, but if you have room to stash him, do it."
-,"Ian Mahinmi plays season-high 29 minutes: Mahinmi made 3-of-5 field goals and 5-of-6 free throws, but this was an aberration for multiple reasons. Starting center Dwight Howard (back) was out again, and Mahinmi hadn't played this many minutes since the 2015-16 postseason. Leave him on the wire."
-,"Austin Rivers quiet in game vs. Doc, Clippers: Rivers was playing vs. his former team, with his father as the opposing coach, and he acknowledged his unique situation prior to the game. 'Lets call it for what it is,' he said. 'I played for my father in the NBA, thats crazy.' He's been a non-entity for fantasy and there's no reason to think that will change as the Wizards try to claw back from a 1-5 start to the season."
0,"Patrick Patterson scores 17 points on 10 FGA: Patterson threw down his first dunk as a member of the Thunder, and seemed rejuvenated to see some shots go in tonight. According to beat writer Brett Dawson, Patterson was 'clearly frustrated' with his shots not falling early this season, and has been 'putting in some extra work.' It paid off tonight but his workload was the product of Steven Adams (calf) being unavailable, so there's no reason to touch him in 12-team leagues."
+,"Rudy Gobert erupts with 23 & 16, three blocks: Gobert made 9-of-13 field goals and 5-of-6 free throws, and five of his rebounds came on the offensive glass. He's opened the season with six consecutive double-doubles and there's no reason to think he'll slow down, especially if Derrick Favors (knee) misses more time. Utah improved to 4-2 tonight and life is good for Gobert's fantasy owners."
0,"Jae Crowder steps up, scores 15 w/ Favors out: Derrick Favors (left knee soreness) was out tonight and the veteran Crowder stepped up in his absence. It's unclear how long Favors might be sidelined, but Crowder was already on the threshold of fantasy value with averages of 11.6 points, 1.6 triples, 5.6 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 0.6 steals. He's an intriguing DFS play if Favors misses more time, but most season-long owners can wait for higher-upside options. Crowder also appeared to tweak his right ankle late in Sunday's game, but there's no reason to suspect it will cause him to miss games."
-,"Georges Niang scores 13 points in 13 minutes: Niang sank two 3-pointers but added just one rebound without any assists or defensive stats. His 13 minutes were a season-high tonight, and that's due to the absence of  Derrick Favors (left knee), so there's very little upside here."
0,"Ricky Rubio recedes after Saturday's surge: Rubio made a 3-pointer tonight but he went 1-of-2 at the line and was generally disappointing after a breakthrough game on Saturday -- 28 points, 12 assists and six boards with efficient shooting. He's had many slow starts throughout his career but tends to finish strong, so patient owners shouldn't give up on him. Just remember that he was a top-50 player after the All-Star break last year."
+,"Elie Okobo has career night Sunday: This was easily his best game of the young season and it came on a night when Isaiah Canaan left early with a sprained left ankle in the first quarter. The Suns already have nothing to play for and it would make sense for them to just let the kids play, and learn something in the process. We don't know the severity of Canaan's injury yet, but if you've got an extra bench spot sitting empty, or with some dead weight, taking a flier on Okobo might make sense. The Suns have said they'll trade for a veteran point guard, but that doesn't mean they will. And with Devin Booker (hamstring) also hurt, Okobo could be in line for some nice minutes in his upcoming three-game week."
0,"Jalen Brunson quiet in 12 minutes w/ DSJ back: Brunson started Friday's game with Dennis Smith Jr. sidelined by a sprained ankle, but with DSJ sidelined he was relegated to a backup role. The takeaway here is that he's the clear-cut No. 2 at point guard and looks like a solid handcuff for DSJ in deep leagues."
+,"DeAndre Jordan nears triple-double: 19/12/9: DJ's previous career-high was six dimes. He has shown renewed energy with Dallas this year and is racking up early-round fantasy value as a result -- he came in averaging 16.0 points (63.0% FGs, 84.6% FTs), 13.8 boards, 2.0 dimes, 2.0 blocks and 0.6 steals. The free-throw shooting is fluky but his owners aren't complaining, as he currently has a more positive impact at the line than a bunch of FT studs including Jimmy Butler. There's no reason to think he'll drop off as the season progresses, but anything is possible if the 2-4 Mavs eventually fall out of the playoff picture."
0,"Harrison Barnes shoots 3-of-13 on Sunday: A strained right hamstring cost Barnes training camp and the first four games of the regular season. He's still working back to his typical form and is just 8-of-30 from the field (26.7%) in two games, so owners may need to consider benching him until he warms up. He won't contribute many across-the-board stats but is typically a reliable contributor for points and 3-pointers with solid percentages."
0,"T.J. Warren bounces back with 18 points: He scored just three points on Saturday, playing just 18 minutes in a blowout loss to the Grizzlies, but has been the Suns best small forward this season. He got back on track tonight, but will likely struggle on nights Trevor Ariza and Josh Jackson get hot, assuming that ever happens again. Of the three SFs in Phoenix, TJW has easily been the most consistent thus far, despite Saturday's dud."
-,"Josh Jackson quiet in another start: He was also 0-for-3 from downtown, and just can't seem to find his way this season. He's scored eight or fewer points in four of his six games, and has scored eight points in both of his starts. It's early and there's plenty of time for him to get it turned around, but with Trevor Ariza and T.J. Warren playing the same position, Jackson just hasn't been able to get right, even with Devin Booker out with his hamstring injury."
0,"Luka Doncic OK after minor left knee injury: It wasn't all good news, as the rookie shot 5-of-13 from the field with five turnovers in the Mavs' fourth loss of the season. Doncic checked out after his knee injury in the third quarter, but he didn't miss much time and there's no reason to think he's in danger of missing Monday's road game in San Antonio."
+,"Dennis Smith Jr. hits 12-of-19 FGs for 27 pts: DSJ was returning from a right ankle injury that cost him one game, but he obviously didn't miss a beat. Efficiency has been an issue for his fantasy value but after tonight's performance he's making 48.2% of his shots, up from just 37.5% last season. Luka Doncic's playmaking could take the ball out of his hands more than owners would like, and it remains to be seen if he can sustain efficient shooting, but the early returns are encouraging. His return sent Jalen Brunson back to fantasy irrelevance."
0,"Ryan Anderson scores season-high 15 in loss: This was his first trip to double-digit scoring this season, as well as his best game of the year. The 31 minutes were easily a season high and it's possible he's on the verge of getting hot and producing. But he's getting up there at 30 years old, and had been pretty terrible up to this point. We'll need to see it again before thinking about taking the bait."
0,"Jerami Grant scores season-high 14 in start: Now that he's finally in the starting lineup, he could get hot, although he was helped tonight by the fact that Steven Adams was out with a calf injury. Grant's not a must-own player, especially with just three games next week, but he's worth keeping a close eye on as one of the only power forward options, along with Patrick Patterson, in OKC."
0,"Russell Westbrook scores 23 despite shoulder: He now has 16 turnovers in just three games, and has made only one 3-pointer after not even attempting one tonight. He only played four games last season in which he didn't attempt a 3-pointer, so this was a bit of a rarity. It looks like his shoulder injury is becoming a thing of the past and he's not on a minutes limit. The Thunder play three times in Week 3, and Westbrook will hopefully be good to go in all of them."
+,"Nerlens Noel explodes in start for Adams: Those were easily season highs across the board and his previous highs were nine points, seven rebounds and 15 minutes. Yes, he did this against the lowly Suns, and yes, Adams will be back soon enough, but you have to think Noel earned some more playing time, at least in the near future, with this performance. He left the game briefly after taking a shot to the head in the third quarter, but wasn't gone for long. There's no reason to jump on Noel after one good game, but this should officially start your radar on him. And if Adams is ruled out for more games, Noel should be worth using for as long as he's out. And in case you're wondering, the last time he scored at least 20 points in a game was when he had 24 points on Feb. 19 - of 2016! It's just nice to know he can still play."
+,"Markieff Morris (flu) will start on Sunday: Ian Mahinmi and Otto Porter will join him in the Wizards' frontcourt tonight. Morris has quietly surged past his average draft position in fantasy leagues, aided by small-ball center minutes without Dwight Howard (back), so keep trotting him out there."
0,"Markieff Morris (flu) is a game-time decision: He'll warm up prior to making a final call on his status, which is mildly encouraging. If he can't suit up, the Wizards would be even thinner in the frontcourt and we'd expect Ian Mahinmi, Jeff Green and Jason Smith to log extra minutes."
!,"Isaiah Canaan exits w/ sprained left ankle: The Suns were trailing by nearly 20 points prior to halftime and Devin Booker (hamstring) is out tonight, so there was no real need for Canaan to play at less than 100 percent. We're considering him questionable for Wednesday's game vs. the visiting Spurs."
!,"Luc Mbah a Moute (knee) ruled out Sunday: Danilo Gallinari and Montrezl Harrell stand to gain the most, but this doesn't have a huge fantasy impact since Mbah a Moute was averaging a modest 15.3 minutes per game. We're considering him day-to-day going forward."
+,"Kevin Durant racks up 34/8/6 and extras: KD made 11-of-20 field goals and 10-of-11 free throws in yet another ultra-efficient offensive performance. The eventual return of DeMarcus Cousins is the only background concern for Durant owners, as Cousins' usage could take a chunk of touches away from both KD and Steph Curry, but that's no reason to fret. He's simply a lock for elite value as long as he's healthy."
0,"Draymond Green dishes season-high 13 dimes: Green didn't get to the free-throw line and missed all three of his 3-point attempts, leaving him at just 27.3% from deep on the season. Defenses continue to abandon him at the arc, but his fantasy value shouldn't change much whether or not he knocks them down or scores more than his current 8.0 points per game. As long as the dimes and defensive stats are there, he'll be fine."
-,"Alfonzo McKinnie solid in 17 bench minutes: McKinnie made 4-of-5 shots with just one turnover off the bench, and he's quietly carving out a role with Patrick McCaw's contract dispute dragging into November. This was his most well-rounded game of the season for fantasy purposes, though, and he's nowhere near standard-league value."
+,"Stephen Curry has NBA record w/ seven more 3s: Curry has made 48 three-pointers this season, which is more than the combined totals for multiple teams at this early stage of the season -- the Cavaliers (43), Clippers (41), Nuggets (40) and Thunder (33). He's the first player in NBA history to make at least five 3-pointers in seven straight games, and has joined Anthony Davis as the top fantasy assets at this early point in the season. He's already building a case for his third MVP award. The threat of a few late-season DNPs was enough to drop his draft position in many leagues, and owners who scored him in the 6-10 range have to be thrilled with the early returns."
0,"Allen Crabbe scores season-high 14: The rise of Caris LeVert and the strong play of Joe Harris are going to hurt Crabbe's fantasy value going forward, but he does appear to be over his ankle injury. And this was a far cry from his 0-for-7 shooting night last Wednesday. Just keep an eye on him."
+,"Caris LeVert trending back up: He started off the season hot, cooled off for a game last Wednesday, and has gotten back on track over his last two, scoring 23 and 21 points in each of them. He hasn't had a steal in a couple games, but the rest of his numbers are flowing, as his breakout season continues. He's a must-own fantasy player in all leagues."
-,"Andre Iguodala (calf) plays 20 minutes Sunday: Shaun Livingston (right foot soreness) was out tonight and Iguodala led the Warriors' second unit in playing time, although that's not saying much. The former fantasy stud has been an afterthought since joining the Warriors in 2013 and there's no reason to own him outside of very deep leagues."
+,"D'Angelo Russell scores season-high 25: He got off to a slow start this season, but has rendered Spencer Dinwiddie somewhat useless of late, and has really turned it on over his last two games. He's averaging 24.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 5.5 3-pointers over his last two games, hitting 18-of-30 shots, good for 60 percent, and has also knocked down 11-of-17 3-pointers in his last two, good for 65 percent. Hopefully you didn't panic after the slow start."
+,"Jarrett Allen solid in loss to Warriors: He's not blowing anyone's socks off with his production, but he's been quite solid from night to night. He was able to run with the Warriors tonight and helped to render both Damian Jones (2 points, 12 minutes) and Jordan Bell (2 points, 10 minutes) ineffective. Allen's still a breakout candidate, and should only get better with time. Just hang in there with him if you own him."
0,"Joe Harris cools off from downtown: Harris entered the game at No. 4 in the league in 3-point percentage (59.3%), and hit his first two of the night. However, he missed his next four triples (and shots), but has still hit 15 of his last 23 shots from beyond the arc, good for 65 percent. He's been a bit quiet in his last two games, scoring just seven points in each of them, but if you are looking for 3-pointers in your fantasy league, he's probably available."
+,"Jae Crowder starts for Derrick Favors (knee): Georges Niang should also benefit with Favors sidelined, but Crowder is the primary beneficiary. Check back after the game to see how he fared."
+,"Nerlens Noel starts for Steven Adams (calf): This report hit after the 7pm lineup-lock so there will be more than a few frustrated Adams owners in DFS and weekly leagues. Noel's per-minute upside has never been doubted and he's worth a play if Adams misses more games, though this sounds like a minor ailment that won't cost him much time. Jerami Grant and Patrick Patterson should also benefit if Adams can't suit up."
-,"Hamidou Diallo won't play Sunday: It's a disciplinary move from the Thunder which should result in more minutes for Alex Abrines and Terrance Ferguson, though neither guy is appealing as a DFS plug-and-play option. Expect Diallo to resume his typical bench role vs. the Clippers on Tuesday."
-,"Fizdale says Mudiay could eventually start: To be clear, Fizdale will not be bringing Mudiay into the starting lineup initially, as his conditioning isn't quite where it needs to be after sitting out the first six games of the year. However, the fact that he's toying with the idea of starting Mudiay isn't great for Trey Burke and Frank Ntilikina's outlook. The point guard situation in New York is a mess and one that should be avoided in standard leagues."
-,"Moe Harkless (knee) ruled out for Monday: Harkless was forced out of Saturday's game with the knee issue, and this is the same knee that gave him trouble during the preseason. Jake Layman and Evan Turner should split his minutes, but neither of those guys are all that attractive in fantasy hoops. Harkless belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues."
-,Alec Burks (hand) available to play Sunday: Burks is too inconsistent to trust in fantasy hoops.
!,"Andrew Wiggins (quad) questionable Monday: Wiggins has missed the past two games for Minnesota, which has resulted in Josh Okogie moving into the starting lineup, and that trend should hold if Wiggins is out again tomorrow. Owners can expect to get another update following Monday morning's shootaround."
!,"Antetokounmpo (head) questionable Monday: Antetokoumpo took an elbow to the head during Saturday's game, which he said caused him to briefly black out, but it's worth noting that he's not currently in the concussion protocol. We'll have a better idea on his status following Monday morning's shootaround, but if he's out, Ersan Ilyasova may move into the starting lineup and there will be more shots for the main guys in Milwaukee. Stay tuned."
!,D.J. Wilson (hamstring) out Monday vs. TOR: Yup.
-,Courtney Lee (neck) out Monday vs. Nets: Lee remains without an official timetable to return and belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues.
!,"James Johnson (hernia) out Monday vs. SAC: Johnson has yet to make his regular-season debut, but he has been ramping up his activities at recent practices, which suggests he's getting close. Kelly Olynyk and Justise Winslow will continue to split the power forward minutes while Johnson is out."
-,"Devin Harris (hamstring) out Sunday vs. UTA: Head coach Rick Carlisle did say that there's a chance Harris could play on Wednesday against the Lakers, but they aren't in any rush to get him back and don't want to push him. He'll be a negligible part of the rotation this season and belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues."
!,"Julius Randle (foot) probable for Monday: Randle is dealing with plantar fasciitis in his left foot, which is one of the worst words you can read in basketball, but thus far that issue hasn't forced him to spend any time on the sidelines. Anthony Davis (elbow) is questionable for Monday's game, and if he's out, Randle will likely be getting another start."
!,"Anthony Davis (elbow) questionable Monday: Davis missed Saturday's game against the Jazz, which resulted in Julius Randle moving into the starting five, and that's likely what will happen on Monday if AD can't play. Owners can expect to get another update following shootaround, but if he's out, Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic and Randle should all see an uptick in usage, and Jahlil Okafor could see limited minutes off the bench. Stay tuned."
-,"Darius Miller (quad) doubtful for Monday: Miller sat out Saturday's game against the Jazz, and it's looking like Monday will be his second straight game on the sidelines. Wes Johnson and Solomon Hill will split his minutes, but that doesn't mean much in fantasy hoops."
!,"Elfrid Payton (ankle) ruled out for Monday: Payton exited Saturday's game after twisting his ankle, and while he was initially able to play through it, it seems that the ankle swelled up on him overnight. With Payton unavailable on Monday, we could see Tim Frazier enter the starting lineup and there will be more minutes for guys like Ian Clark and Frank Jackson. Jrue Holiday will also spend a bit more time running the offense."
+,"Russell Westbrook (shoulder) will play Sunday: Westbrook sat out Saturday's practice with the shoulder issue, but there's been no word on a minutes limit, so owners shouldn't hesitate to get him active for a favorable matchup vs. Phoenix. Joining Westbrook in the starting five will be Paul George, Terrance Ferguson, Jerami Grant and Steven Adams."
-,"Jalen Brunson will come off the bench Sunday: Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) will be back in action tonight following a one-game stint on the sidelines, so Brunson's minutes will likely trend back towards the teens. He's not a viable target in most settings while the point guards in Dallas are healthy."
+,"Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) will play on Sunday: DSJ sat out Friday's game, but he'll be back out there tonight with his normal minutes, which will shift Jalen Brunson back to the second unit. Feel free to get him active."
-,"Andre Iguodala (calf) will play on Sunday: Iguodala should see his normal minutes with the second unit today, but he's not bringing enough to the box score to warrant any attention in fantasy hoops."
-,"Jarred Vanderbilt (foot) still 'a ways away': The Nuggets will bring him along slowly, but even when he's cleared to play, he'll be a non-factor in the rotation."
-,Justin Anderson (leg) out Monday vs. 76ers: He's yet to make his season debut and shouldn't be owned anywhere.
-,"Shaun Livingston out Sunday; doubtful Monday: Livingston tweaked his right foot just prior to the season opener, and it appears it's developed into a nagging issue. With the 33-year-old guard set to miss the next two games, we'll see some more Quinn Cook with the second unit, but that doesn't mean much with Stephen Curry healthy."
0,"Cavs weighing how long to sit Kevin Love: The Cavs just fired Tyronn Lue and are 0-6. Love is looking at a potential extended absence as the Cavs weather the storm. With Love out, everyone on the Cavs will see more looks and Larry Nance, Sam Dekker, and Channing Frye will see more time at power forward."
-,"Thabo Sefolosha (left ankle) available Sunday: Sefolosha has yet to play this season and is unlikely to be a factor in the rotation for the Jazz. However, he could see an uptick in minutes with Derrick Favors set to miss this one."
!,"Russell Westbrook (shoulder) questionable: Westbrook didn't practice on Saturday and with no shootaround on Sunday, he's shaping up to be a game-time decision. Stay tuned for updates."
!,Derrick Favors (knee) is out on Sunday: Favors hasn't looked healthy and has battled soreness in his knee for at least a week now. Jae Crowder stands to benefit a good bit from his absence. Georges Niang is also likely to see an uptick in minutes.
0,J.J. Barea (hamstring) probable on Sunday: Barea played through his hamstring issue on Friday and looks set to do so again on Sunday. He's decent source of assists in the short-term.
0,"Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) probable for Sunday: DSJ tweaked his ankle in Wednesday's game and did not play on Friday, with Jalen Brunson starting in his absence. He warmed up prior to Friday's game, but just didn't feel right. We'll know his status for sure a little bit later on. Stay tuned."
-,Shaun Livingston (foot) questionable Sunday: Livingston played just nine minutes in the Warriors' previous game and they'll likely proceed with caution with the veteran. Quinn Cook would see an increase in action with Livingston out.
-,"Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle) probable for Monday: Mudiay is set to make his season debut. As it stands, he's not worth owning in any format."
-,Zhou Qi (knee) returns to practice Sunday: Qi has not played this season and is unlikely to be a factor in the Rockets' rotation with them at full strength.
-,"Marquese Chriss (ankle) returns to practice: Chriss has a chance to earn minutes as the backup center, but isn't guaranteed to do so with Isaiah Hartenstein playing well. Chriss isn't worth a roster spot right now."
!,Dwight Howard (back) listed as out Sunday: Howard has yet to make his Wizards debut and seems unlikely to make it on Sunday. Ian Mahinmi will continue to start in his absence.
!,"Andre Iguodala (calf) questionable for Sunday: Iguodala has dealt with this minor calf ailment for about a week now, but hasn't missed any game action. The Warriors will continue to monitor him closely. Jonas Jerebko and Alfonzo McKinnie would see more minutes in the event that Iguodala were to sit this one out."
!,"Devin Booker (hamstring) out Sunday vs. OKC: Booker was able to get up some shots during shootaround, but he didn't have much lift on his jumper, which isn't a great sign regarding his status for Wednesday's game against the Spurs. Josh Jackson and Elie Okobo will see an uptick in minutes in Booker's absence, and Deandre Ayton will be very busy on offense."
-,Dzanan Musa recalled from Nets' G-League team: Musa as assigned to the G-League earlier on Sunday and it was probably just a procedural move. He's not on the fantasy radar.
+,"No plan to sit Kawhi Leonard in back-to-back: 'We're gonna go play 'em,' Nurse said. 'He's feeling good and feeling fine, and we'll go from there.' Leonard sat out the second-half of the Raps' first back-to-back, but it's great to hear that he's healthy enough to not have them planning to sit him. He's been a stud so far and will continue to be one as long as he's playing."
-,"Delon Wright, OG Anunoby expected back Monday: Wright came back and felt tightness in his injured groin, which limited him to five minutes in his season debut. He was likely to be limited in that game anyway, so they took no chances. Fred VanVleet is questionable, so the Raptors could use Wright off the bench. He's more important to his team than he is to fantasy owners and is best left as a free agent in most leagues."
-,"OG Anunoby (personal) expected to play Monday: Anunoby didn't practice Sunday and still isn't with the team, but is expected to meet them in Milwaukee ahead of their matchup with the undefeated Bucks. He'll be tasked with trying to slow Giannis Antetokounmpo, which is helpful to the Raps but not helpful to fantasy owners. He's best left on the wire in most leagues."
0,"Fred VanVleet (toe) questionable for Monday: VanVleet is a key cog in the Raptors bench unit, so they're playing it safe with him as he still has some pain. He was originally probable to play on Friday, but ended up being held out. Delon Wright is expected to return and should see an uptick in minutes if FVV were to miss his third straight game."
0,"Dwyane Wade says Heat want to shoot 100 FGs: 'We didnt even reach our goal tonight,' Wade said. 'We wanted to shoot 100 shots. We didnt get there. We got close. Its fast-paced. Its get looks up, contested threes, open threes, rhythm threes. Thats just the game it is.' They took 96 shots, just shy of their stated goal. The Heat are embracing the league's fast-paced revolution, which is great for the fantasy outlook of their many relevant players. More shots means more opportunities to produce, as shown by the Heat having eight guys averaging points in double-figures."
!,"Kevin Knox's (ankle) timetable is 2-3 weeks: The elder Knox said that his son did not suffer a high-ankle sprain and that his pain is now down to a 3 after it being a 9 immediately following the injury (on a scale of 1-10). Knox was getting some shots up at Knicks practice on Friday and is slowly getting closer to making his return. Damyean Dotson, Mario Hezonja, Allonzo Trier, Noah Vonleh, and Mitchell Robinson are among the guys benefiting from Knox's absence. We have yet to hear anything official from the Knicks."
+,"Cristiano Felicio keeps playing over RoLo: Felicio even played the final 15 minutes over Wendell Carter Jr. because he was playing well. Lopez appears to be destined for a trade, making Felicio a potential add in deep-leagues and a cheap option in DFS moving forward."
0,"Aron Baynes (hamstring) to be ready Tuesday?: Coach Brad Stevens said the team wanted to be cautious with Baynes, which is why he sat out on Saturday against the Pistons. His eventual return will take minutes from Daniel Theis, Guerschon Yabusele, and Marcus Morris."
-,"'Just not enough time' for Wayne Ellington: 'Just wasnt enough minutes tonight,' Spoelstra said. 'But Wayne has been through this before. Two years ago, he was out for more than six weeks and he found his way back in. Its still early on. But I love the fact that hes back in uniform.' With Rodney McGruder playing well, Ellington might not see much time. The Heat are still without James Johnson and Dion Waiters, meaning minutes will be even tougher to come back for a few guys, including Ellington. He's safe to leave on the waiver wire."
+,"Hassan Whiteside proves pivotal in big win: '[Whiteside] mentioned that he was just trying to do whatever he could to put his fingerprints on this win,' coach Erik Spoelstra said. 'And down the stretch, that was a couple big contests to force some misses and a couple big rebounds. And even the offensive rebound. Thats winning basketball.' Whiteside blocked six shots and secured 16 rebounds. The Heat have been much better with him on the floor this year, which is great for his fantasy value."
-,"Dzanan Musa assigned to Nets' G-League team: Musa hasn't played much this season, even with the Nets numerous injuries. He was picked 29th in the 2018 Draft and the Nets like his long-term outlook."
!,"Giannis Antetokounmpo (head) blacked out: He said all concussion tests were negative, which allowed him to return to the game in the fourth quarter. Even though tests were negative at the time, that doesn't mean symptoms won't crop up today or tomorrow. Hopefully that isn't the case, but concussions can be tricky. The Bucks next play on Monday 10/29."
0,"Tyreke Evans (personal) is back with the team: 'I was late for practice,' said Evans. 'This is the most professional and team-oriented organization I have been with in my career. They deserve my best every day and I am disappointed in myself for causing a distraction that prevents me from being able to help my team tomorrow. I will do better.' Evans realizes he made a mistake and is ready to return to action."
-,Pau Gasol has first double-double of season: Gasol has only played more than 20 minutes once this season and looks unlikely to reach that number most nights. He's only blocked one shot thus far and that doesn't help his fantasy value. Pau is a low-end center in deeper leagues.
-,"Dante Cunningham, scores four in start: He was out there to guard LeBron James and that was pretty much it. Cunningham has routinely been one of the lowest usage rate players among rotation options, and he doesn't add defensive stats. Leave him on the wire."
-,"Davis Bertans doesn't score in start: He came off the bench in his four games this year, but he didn't start the second half. Bertans won't have much value while Rudy Gay is healthy."
-,"Jakob Poeltl gets another DNP-CD: As talented as he is and as helpful as he was in Toronto, coach Gregg Popovich just doesn't trust Poeltl yet."
+,"Rudy Gay doesn't start, still double-doubles: Gay didn't start the first half, but did start the second half. Coach Gregg Popovich has juggled his lineups based on matchups so far this year and Gay was impacted by that tonight. Still, he was very productive and still managed 33 minutes. He has two consecutive double-doubles and should be a reasonably steady contributor moving forward."
-,"Marc Gasol puts up 19/8/3, 3 steals in win: That scary neck issue was an afterthought as the Grizzlies handled their business on offense to put this game away early. Thanks to a 42-point fourth, they had a 25-point lead at half to tie largest halftime lead in a home game since a 25-point edge in 2005. As for Gasol, his fantasy owners may want to sell high at their best opportunity given his injury history and at age 33."
+,"DeMar DeRozan nears triple-double w/ 30/12/8: DeRozan was a big reason why the Spurs came back to win against the Lakers. He's not attempting many triples, but he's still scoring at a steady rate. Add on his assists and he's been an exceptional fantasy option so far. The Spurs need him to handle and score and he's been doing both so far. He's scored 28+ in four of his first five games with the Spurs. He's going to have a big year."
0,"Jaren Jackson Jr. scores six in 15 minutes: Foul trouble got him this time and that issue has re-surfaced with 5.0 fouls over his last four. That aside, JJJ is cleaning up with blocks and has a steal in each game -- three in the opener. With JaMychal Green still out, Jackson Jr. will have plenty of leash to improve on his mistakes. Maybe this could be a mini-opportunity to buy low."
-,"Dillon Brooks score eight in 27 minutes: He had a good amount of volume in his rookie season, but the Grizzlies have a decent NBA roster this time around. Brooks won't offer enough upside in most leagues."
-,"MarShon Brooks loves garbage time: Garbage time special here with 10 in the fourth to make his night. He may stay in the rotation because of the injury to Chandler Parsons (knee), but he's only worth a flier in deep leagues."
0,"Lonzo Ball scores just 6 points in 27 minutes: Ball remained in the starting lineup with Rajon Rondo back from suspension, but he saw less court time. In the three games without Rondo, Ball averaged 6.7 assists. In the three games with Rondo, Ball has averaged just 2.7 assists. The Lakers have a lot to figure out with their rotation and it looks like Lonzo will be inconsistent for the near future. Better days are ahead."
0,"Aaron Gordon hits 3-of-15 shots in loss: He missed all six of his triples, adding five rebounds, two assists and one steal. On the bright side, he was the only starter that played more than 27 minutes, so hopefully his floor will be safer in future blowouts -- those are quite common in Orlando."
-,"Kyle Anderson scores two points in 21 minutes: Yeah, so Slow-Mo has been more like No-Go. Nobody expected Anderson to light up the scoring column, but 3.8 points per game over his first five is not gonna cut it. He's not having much offense go through him, the defensive stats haven't been there and he's only playing 21.9 minutes per game. He's looking like a drop in shallower formats or for a hotter free agent."
+,"Rajon Rondo plays 29 minutes in return: Rondo came off the bench but still saw 29 minutes in Saturday's loss. He's clearly a big part of the Lakers plans, at least for now. He's been seeing staggered minutes with LeBron, but gets time closing out games. Rondo's also hit at least one triple in his three games this year, which would be a great development for his fantasy value. The Lakers have a lot to sort out with Brandon Ingram returning next game and Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart emerging. Still, Rondo remains a fantasy option due to his assists."
+,"Deandre Ayton drops a 24/8/5 line in loss: Impressive. Sure, a lot of his stats came when the game was decided, but the Suns got much more than they bargained for with his touch on offense and his excellent passing out of the post. Ayton is more than just a rim-running big and it's hard to believe he's played just five NBA games, averaging 17.8 points, 10.2 boards, 0.8 blocks and 0.6 steals on 69.6 FG% and 84.6 FT%. He looks like the real deal."
+,"Nikola Vucevic scores 16 points vs. MIL: Don't read into the low minutes because this game was over in a hurry. Vucevic was the 10th ranked fantasy player in 9-category leagues entering tonights game and Mo Bamba doesnt appear to be a threat to his workload right now. In fact, coach Steve Clifford said Bamba is not anywhere near ready to start and gushed about Vucevics play. It also helps that Orlando lacks a starting-level PG, as Vucevic is on pace for a career-high in assists (4.8). Hes crushing his ADP and fantasy owners should enjoy the ride."
0,"Mo Bamba plays 23 minutes vs. Bucks: The Magic cant really use Bamba next to Nikola Vucevic for long stretches right now, as that combo has a brutal -62.5 net rating through the first five games. Sure it's a small sample size, but its just something the rookie isnt ready for. Hes more of a stash for blocks-needy owners with Vucevic dominating in the first unit."
0,"Elie Okobo has nice night vs. Grizzlies: It was good showing in his first shot at the rotation with Devin Booker (hamstring) out. Okobo has good fundamentals on offense and he's been a good cutter since Vegas, so that could translate for when the Suns want to put him next to Booker eventually. Just keep an eye on him in super deep leagues."
0,"Donte DiVincenzo scores 15 points vs. ORL: DiVincenzo was playing 20.0 minutes per game prior to Saturday, taking some of the minutes that Tony Snell had last season. He hasnt been very productive yet with 6.2 points, 3.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 0.4 blocks, 0.4 steals and 1.0 triples prior to Saturday, but its starting to look like he will benefit the most if any of the starting five picks up an injury."
0,"Josh Jackson has a brutal night in start: Yeah, 0.4 points per possession is not good. Since summer league, Jackson continues to take shots he shouldn't and try to make plays that aren't there. He's lost a lot of his momentum he built from January to April, but the Suns will likely let him have his growing pains. Devin Booker (hamstring) should be back soon, so that could get Jackson back into his comfort zone."
+,"LeBron James drops season-high 35 w/11 boards: After three straight double-digit assists games, LeBron posted a season-low four assists. It's no coincidence that Rajon Rondo returned from a 3-game suspension tonight. LeBron's not handling the ball as much with Rondo in the lineup and the assist totals show that. Still, LeBron is a fantasy monster no matter how much we nitpick."
+,"Malcolm Brogdon scores 16 points in easy win: Brogdon is flirting with top-100 value and was averaging 11.6 points, 4.4 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 1.6 triples in 31.6 minutes entering tonights game. 'Complete credit to [coach Mike Budenholzer], not only do we have a great system that plays to our strengths...but he takes care of our bodies,' Brogdon said. 'We don't feel run down.' The Bucks are off to their best start in franchise history (6-0) and their entire starting lineup is on pace to finish inside the top-100 in Buds fantasy-friendly offense."
0,"Isaiah Canaan scores 11 in bad loss: He didn't really get a Devin Booker (hamstring) bump because the Suns went young. Booker isn't going to be out long, but Canaan could have some value for PG-needy owners."
+,"Khris Middleton scores 18 points vs. ORL: Middleton is crushing it to begin the season, posting top-15 value in 9-category leagues. His elite true shooting percentage (70.8%) ranks in the top five among wings, and hes hitting 57.9% of his pull-up triples which ranks third in the NBA. Coach Mike Budenholzer encouraged him over the summer to cut out his mid-range shot and focus on 3-pointers, and were already seeing the dividends with 4.4 3-pointers per game compared to 1.8 last season."
0,"T.J. Warren plays just 18 minutes: The Suns went heavy with their rookies and it hurt Warren's playing time in this ugly loss. This wasn't a concern heading into the night, so Warren's fantasy owners shouldn't panic yet. Devin Booker (hamstring) shouldn't be out long."
+,"Giannis Antetokounmpo scores 19 in win: He went back to the locker room a couple of times after an early collision with Aaron Gordon, but fantasy owners can breathe easy because he's going to be just fine. Giannis is leading the NBA in usage rate (34.6%), and once his efficiency picks back up he should right back in the top-5 of 9-category rankings."
-,"Mikal Bridges scores seven in 24 minutes: The Suns went back to their preseason rotation with Bridges as a backup wing, and that could continue while Devin Booker (hamstring) is out. Still, Bridges is nowhere near the fantasy map in 12-team leagues and he still hasn't shown any flashes dating back to Vegas."
0,"Kelly Olynyk scores 19 points vs. Blazers: After playing 16 or less minutes in the opening three games, Olynyk has responded with back-to-back strong performances. He was 6-of-9 from the field and 4-of-5 from the line tonight, and he's averaging 15.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.0 triples over his last two games. Now that he's hot again, Olynyk is worth a look in standard leagues if you're targeting points, triples, out-of-position assists and shooting percentages."
0,"Nicolas Batum scores just 2 points in 31 mins: Batum has not shot the ball well of late and has ceded most play-making duties to Kemba Walker. Batum is still a nice source of stats across the board, but might not produce the 5+ assists per game we've become accustom to with Walker running the show. The Hornets have a bunch of young wings that are coming for his time, but Batum will continue to hold them off because of his versatility. Don't panic."
-,"Ryan Anderson scores seven in 22 minutes: Even with the Suns losing depth, they're just not going to play Anderson big minutes."
0,"Ryan Arcidiacono  goes off vs. Hawks: It was his best game as he dominated Trae Young to help the Bulls get the win.  Arcidiacono isn't exactly a top prospect despite his time at Villanova, so he would only be worth a speculative look in deep leagues. Even if he does beat out Cam Payne, Kris Dunn should be back next month."
0,"Goran Dragic scores 28 points on 10-of-19 FGs: The Heat improved to 3-2 because of Dragic's heroics, and he added five assists, three boards and four triples in 35 minutes. He has now attempted at least 14 shots in four out of five games, but could lose some touches with the Heat finally getting some bodies back."
-,"Bam Adebayo scores seven points: Hassan Whiteside is healthy and motivated, and Kelly Olynyk is starting to heat up after his slow start. With James Johnson nearing a return, we see no reason to stash Bam right now."
+,"Wendell Carter Jr. posts double-double: He's from Atlanta and maybe that helped him get going after a rough start to his career.  The best news is Carter Jr. only had one foul and one turnover, so keeping those in check will go a long way. Rookies need time to get their feet wet and he has the starting job locked up, but WJC has enough upside to allow a lot leash in standard leagues."
-,"Tyler Johnson scores seven points vs. POR: Wayne Ellington was cleared to return from his ankle injury, but picked up a DNP-CD. Johnson hasn't played well this season and is on thin ice, so there's a chance he loses some minutes in the near future. He belongs on the waiver wire in standard leagues."
+,"Zach LaVine scores 27 points with 11 boards: Make it six straight with 20-plus points for the longest stretch of his career. He was a little sloppy as evident by the turnovers, and those elevated his usage rate to 33.5 on the year. His shot selection is getting a little worse after being almost flawless to start the year, but he's still at an outstanding 65.2 TS%. His scoring breakout continues and his owners should expect him to be around 25 per game."
+,"Kemba Walker scores 37 on 31 shots in loss: Walker was one of two Hornets to take double-digit shots, with Jeremy Lamb being the other at just 12 attempts. Kemba is running the show and has the ball in his hands most of the time. Even though he couldn't get his shot to fall, he still managed to get to the line 14 times (12-of-14). Even when he's off, he's still producing. Kemba's a top-20 player going forward."
-,"Justise Winslow makes season debut vs. POR: There's no way coach Erik Spoelstra is taking Rodney McGruder out of the starting lineup, so Winslow will likely continue anchoring the second unit. He's just a lukewarm pickup in deeper leagues and has some efficiency concerns."
-,"Derrick Jones Jr. picks up a DNP-CD: Airplane Mode was cleared to play tonight and is healthy again, but may be out of the rotation for the time being with Justise Winslow back in the lineup. Jones Jr. belongs on the wire outside of dynasty formats."
-,"Chandler Hutchison scores four: He did get some minutes at small forward next to Jabari Parker, but Hutchison isn't quite ready to be a contributor as a scorer and he's not going to add defensive stats. He'll likely need garbage time to put up value in deep of DFS leagues."
-,"Wayne Ellington picks up a DNP-CD: His season debut will have to wait despite the Heat calling him 'available.' With the way Rodney McGruder has looked alongside Josh Richardson, Ellington's path to fantasy value isn't great."
-,"Shaq Harrison makes Bulls debut: His minutes came as a wing, but Harrison did handle the ball a bunch. He had a good run in his brief time with a +6, but there's no need to add him almost anywhere."
0,"Jusuf Nurkic scores five points vs. MIA: This was his first dud of the season and he ran into an in-form Hassan Whiteside, so his owners should cut him some slack. Zach Collins has made a case for a larger role, but Nurk Alert is still on pace to comfortably outperform his ADP. His owners should be in a good spot next week with five games on the schedule."
0,"Cam Payne flops against the Hawks: Ryan Arcidiacono took over late in this game and coach Fred Hoiberg didn't want to go back to Payne. He had played well in his previous two, so his owners should stick with him."
+,"Zach Collins scores 13 points vs. Heat: He played just six minutes in the first half with two quick fouls, but came alive in the second half. Collins was averaging 10.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 2.3 blocks and 1.0 triples entering Saturday's game and has been a mid-round value despite playing around 20 minutes. With Portland playing five games next week, Collins is a great pickup in standard leagues to see if he can keep this going."
+,"Robert Covington double-doubles w/ 4 blocks: Lord Covington stuffed the stat sheet and had a superb all-around game in this one. He had a late block on Kemba Walker that helped the Sixers seal the win. He struggled from the free throw line, but he's usually a good free throw shooter. He only posted four double-doubles last year with Ben Simmons in the fold. Nights like this are why RoCo is a valuable fantasy asset."
-,"Jake Layman plays 12 minutes: Hes been hanging around 12 minutes per game this season despite being a 'starter.' Even with Moe Harkless knee flaring up again, Layman simply isnt relevant in most fantasy leagues. Evan Turner is the better deep-league pickup."
+,"Trae Young struggles in favorable matchup: Ice Trae melted in this one, missing all six from deep and getting torched by Ryan Arcidiacono. Young continues to dominate the rock as one of the leaders in time of possession, his usage rate is better than expected and the Hawks are flying with an NBA-high 108.6 pace."
-,"Evan Turner scores eight points vs. MIA: He might have a few more minutes coming his way, as Moe Harkless left knee flared up on him again and he wasnt able to return. Turner has been quiet up to this point with 9.8 points, 5.3 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.0 steals with no triples entering Saturdays game, and its unlikely that Harkless latest setback will catapult Turner into standard-league relevance."
+,"Damian Lillard drops 42 points in loss to MIA: Apparently the heckling fan from Thursday is still in the back of Lillard's head. That's his 18th career game with 40+ points which moves him past Clyde Drexler for most in Trail Blazers history. He's got the Western Conference Player of the Week Award locked up as he's coming off a 41-point game vs. Orlando, and we're still feeling confident about calling him a top-10 fantasy asset the rest of the way."
0,"DeAndre Bembry fills the defensive stats: Last season was about as bad as it could get, but this year he's making up ground. Coach Lloyd Pierce has praised Bembry's ability to break down defenses, and it's reflected in the rotation with Bembry getting at least 27 minutes in three of the last four. He's not quite standard-league material yet, but that could change if the Hawks unload some guys."
+,"Joel Embiid (ankle) double-doubles w/ 27 & 14: It wasn't clear before the game whether or not Embiid would be limited by the ankle tweak he suffered in Friday's practice, but he removed all doubt once the game began. Embiid now has six consecutive double-doubles to start the season and has played 33+ minutes in each game. He'll have an injury scare every now and then, but he's a fantasy monster when he's available."
+,"Ben Simmons double-doubles w/ just 3 dimes: Simmons posted a shockingly-low assist total tonight, but that's probably because he took a season-high 20 shots. Despite only three assists, he's still averaging over seven per game thus far. It was nice to see him in attack mode from the jump, but the efficiency obviously needs to be better. Simmons might be asked to be in attack mode more often with Markelle Fultz able to run the offense, too. Keep rolling Simmons out there with confidence."
+,"Dewayne Dedmon posts 13 and 13, 5 blocks: He kept the Hawks in this game with a team-high +18. Dedmon looked like himself in this game after his avulsion fracture kept him out of camp and the first week of the season. Bigs can be tough to come by and the Hawks don't have Alex Poythress (knee) now, so Dedmon is worth a long look for anyone needing a big man."
0,Giannis Antetokounmpo (head) returns again: Giannis has been in and out for most of the game due to an early collision with Aaron Gordon. Hopefully we find out more information once the game concludes.
+,"Rodney Hood scores 17 points in loss to IND: He had a 23.2 usage rate with Kevin Love (foot) sitting out another game and led the Cavaliers in points and shot attempts and was second to Cedi Osman in minutes. Hood was hitting just 38.6% of his shots before Saturday, but has scored in double digits in each game so far. Hood might be relevant for the foreseeable future because of the lack of talent in Cleveland."
+,"Rudy Gobert posts 25 and 14 with 4 blocks: It was like he was playing college kids with easy shots around the rim all night, and owning the paint on defense.  Gobert has been automatic with the ball, making 76.9% from the field with a respectable 71.9% from the line to get him to a 78.2 TS% on his 15.5 usage rate. He's also playing at a 105.0 pace, so this could be Gobert's best year yet."
-,"Sam Dekker quiet in a start: He was 3-of-7 from the field with no turnovers. Love has missed two games in a row with foot soreness and the 0-6 Cavaliers will be patient with him, but we don't see a reason to pick up Dekker yet. Larry Nance looks like the big winner."
+,"Ricky Rubio scores 28 points in win over Pels: He needed this one after a putrid 21.9% from the field in his first four. Anyone who has owned Rubio in the past will tell you all about his dreadful starts over the last few years, but picked up speed down the home stretch like Seabiscuit. Rubio should hold mid-round value on the year and the extra pace could help his ceiling."
-,"J.R. Smith plays six minutes: Cavaliers coach Ty Lue is on record saying he wants to get Smith more involved, but the front office wants him to focus on the younger guys. Its pretty obvious that Smith isnt going to be useful in fantasy leagues any time soon."
0,"David Nwaba scores seven points: He played a total of six minutes across two appearances prior to Saturday, so hes still irrelevant in all fantasy leagues. As bad as Cleveland has been, this could set Nwaba up for more run as we get closer to the new year."
+,"Larry Nance double-doubles w/ four dimes: That's a season-high in points and rebounds and he's now played 20+ minutes in three straight. Kevin Love (foot) is already banged, the Cavs are winless and have very little talent, so all signs point to Nance becoming one of Cleveland's top fantasy assets going forward. He should be owned in standard leagues and should have some starts coming his way."
+,"Donovan Mitchell scores 22 points in easy win: He has been outstanding against two good teams, and he even gave Jrue Holiday the business all game. Mitchell dropped 38 points in Houston and he's back on track with efficiency, and he's handed out 13 dimes to just four turnovers in those two wins. Mitchell should lead the Jazz in scoring as he puts up early-round value in fantasy."
-,"Bojan Bogdanovic scores 25 points vs. CLE: We can't overreact here, as Tyreke Evans (personal) did not suit up. His minutes are down a bit this season and he's been hit-or-miss with two single-digit scoring games through six contests, so he's just a borderline standard-league asset with limited upside."
-,"Derrick Favors scores 10 in 19 minutes: Maybe it's his knee, but Favors has that look of a guy lacking explosiveness again. He does have two blocks in each of his last three games, so that's helped soften the blow of scoring just 9.8 points and 7.3 boards in his previous four. He may not be worth owning in shallower leagues with Jae Crowder getting a lot of run."
0,"Dante Exum scores 11 in 18 minutes: The Exum non-PG talk hasn't exactly come to fruition, but he's excelled in his role behind Ricky Rubio. Exum may not hold much fantasy value now, but that would likely change if anything happened to the starting perimeter guys."
!,"Giannis Antetokounmpo (head) not starting 3Q: It remains to be seen if this is related to his first half issue, but it likely is. We'll be sure to update as we know more."
0,"Thaddeus Young scores 10 points: Hes playing about three fewer minutes per game this season, and his steals are down from 1.7 in 2017-18 to 1.0 this season. Maybe he can get his steals back up because he averaged 1.5+ takeaways in three straight seasons, but his FT% (42.9) is way down as well. If you want to drop him for a hot free agent its not a bad idea since Young will likely just be a late-round guy."
+,"Nikola Mirotic scores 25 points: It was definitely his time to shine with Anthony Davis (elbow) out and Julius Randle being neutralized by Rudy Gobert. Mirotic did also play some minutes as the lone big, so that could be in the cards if AD needs to miss more time -- it's not a serious injury. Mirotic has been on fire all year and looks like a fantasy steal."
0,"Cory Joseph scores seven points: Hes quietly having one of his best seasons yet with 9.0 points, 3.6 assists, 3.8 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 1.6 triples prior to Saturday. Tyreke Evans (personal) was out, so Joseph saw a season-high in minutes tonight. Darren Collison finally got back on track, so Joseph is still just a deep-league asset until further notice."
+,"Jrue Holiday has another good stats game: That's two good games in a row for Holiday following 26 points on Friday, and he had a little flash and flare on the offensive side today. There was never any need to panic after Holiday's slow start and he should be back on track as an early-round player."
+,"Myles Turner scores 15 points on 7-of-10 FGs: An aggressive Myles Turner isnt as common these days, with this being only his third game out of six with double-digit shot attempts. Hopefully tonight gives him some confidence to keep firing away, because he has nowhere to go but up with one of the safest floors in fantasy  hes pretty much a lock for top-50 value because he can get you two blocks per night with excellent percentages. If this game was a little closer, this line could have been a lot better."
+,"Darren Collison scores 15 points w/ 6 dimes: Collison had really been struggling, but this was the perfect storm with Tyreke Evans (personal) out and the Cavaliers ranking 28th in defensive efficiency. He cruised to a top-50 finish last season, so his owners just need to hang in there and hope that tonight is a sign of things to come."
0,"Julius Randle scores just 12 points: He'll be seeing Rudy Gobert in his dreams tonight with Gobert keeping Randle away from easy paint points, and Gobert owned him when the Jazz had the rock. Randle looked healthy and there's been no concern about his plantar fascia, so expect him to be a full go this week. Anthony Davis should be back, as well."
0,"Frank Jackson capitalizes on minutes: He was behind Ian Clark in the rotation tonight with Elfrid Payton (ankle) hurt, but Jackson outplayed every Pelican guard not named Jrue Holiday. Jackson has looked terrific in a small sample in the preseason and in Vegas, so he could be a name to watch in super deep leagues."
0,"Solomon Hill scores 11 in 20 minutes: He was the first forward off the bench as he came in for Julius Randle to push Nikola Mirotic to the five. Hill could see minutes close to 20 while Anthony Davis (elbow) recovers, but it doesn't sound like he'll be out long."
-,"Jahlil Okafor gets in the rotation: He was the first true big off the bench and looks to be ahead of Cheick Diallo. Still, the Pelicans pace is not Okafor's style, despite his mostly vegan diet. Assuming Anthony Davis (elbow) isn't out for long, leave him on the wire just about everywhere."
-,"Ian Clark scores two in 13 minutes: He picked up some extra rotation minutes with Elfrid Payton (ankle) getting hurt today. While Payton could not play for most of the second half, he was initially able to return after an ankle tweak in the first half. In other words, it doesn't sound serious, so Clark is only a speculative add in the deepest of leagues."
-,"Cheick Diallo behind Jah Okafor: The Pelicans were blown out, so the 11 minutes are misleading due to garbage time. Jahlil Okafor is ahead of Diallo for now."
-,"Moe Harkless (knee soreness) will not return: Not good. That's his bad knee and it keeps flaring up on him. Considering how long he's been dealing with this issue, it might make some sense for the Blazers to shut him down until he gets right. Jake Layman and Evan Turner could pick up some run, but there's not a fantasy pickup here."
-,"Kyrie Irving scores just three points vs. DET: It's the lowest scoring game with at least 20 minutes in his entire NBA career. Irving's dip in usage has been a trend all year, but only using seven possessions is a stunner tonight. Besides scoring, his stats are pretty much on par with the expectation, but Irving sitting at just 14.0 points per game is nowhere near even his biggest naysayers had him. He is a buy-low candidate, but the odds look to be against him in hitting early-round value this season."
0,"Daniel Theis scores 17 points in easy win: His foot sprain clearly didn't bother him, but he did suffer a heel injury and didn't talk to the media. Theis was setting a lot of screens up high in the second unit, and his guards set him up with great looks all over the court. Aron Baynes (hamstring) could miss more time, but Theis is more of a deep-league target of a DFS punt. Garbage time helped him tonight, too."
-,"Jaylen Brown scores 19 points vs. Pistons: Finally. Brown was a shell of himself on offense before today, and a hot start helped him carry the first unit offensively. With Jayson Tatum making a leap, there won't be many shots to go around in this offense and Brown has been subpar in percentages without really anything to hang his hat on in the box scores, so he's probably not worth holding in shallower leagues."
0,"Gordon Hayward scores 15 in 24 minutes: It was his most efficient shooting game from the floor, and it was encouraging to see coach Brad Stevens kept Hayward in there until the middle of the fourth with the Celtics up about 25 to get him close to his prescribed 25 minutes. The Celtics continue to get him around 25 minutes per game and there's no word that he'll have that limit elevated any time soon."
+,"Terry Rozier scores 14 points in 25 minutes: This was slightly aided by garbage time, but Rozier had a strong first half to help the Celtics pull away. The Boston second unit has been outstanding this year with Rozier being among the league leaders in defensive rating. Kyrie Irving just hasn't looked like himself, so maybe Rozier can find a path to more minutes. Plus, Boston blowing people out is good for his value."
0,"Blake Griffin makes 2-of-13 from the field: As it turns, he wasn't going to shoot 65.2% from deep like he had in the first four. The Celtics defended Griffin tighter on the wing and it limited him from getting better looks off screens, and they also kept him from getting to the line with just four attempts. His 33.8 points per game was not sustainable, but Griffin could score in the upper 20s and should be in line for a big season under coach Dwane Casey."
-,"Reggie Bullock struggles again: Maybe this shoulder thing is bothering him. He's having a rough start to the year, but it's not like anyone else is stepping up while Bullock struggles. He should continue to see big minutes and the loss of Luke Kennard (shoulder) secures his role even more. That said, if you want to drop Bullock because of his poor play, it's not like people in your 12-team league are going to be dropping any decent FAAB or a high waiver on him."
0,"Andre Drummond only has eight boards: It's the first time he failed to get a double-double and coach Dwane Casey may have kept Drummond in there in garbage time to avoid snapping his streak. Before tonight, Drummond was just a shade under 27% in total rebounding rate and he had 17.8 boards per game over the first four, so he'll likely rebound against Boston again on Tuesday."
0,"Stanley Johnson scores 16 points: Before today, things couldn't have gone much worse for Johnson in the first three, making just 30.4 percent from the field. Even in what has been his best game of the year in this bad loss, it's not like this will move the needle on him as a pickup in fantasy. If he has 2-3 more games like this in the next week, maybe Johnson can garner the attention of fantasy owners."
0,Giannis Antetokounmpo (head) returns to game: He was only in the locker room for a few minutes so hopefully he's fine going forward.
!,Giannis Antetokounmpo (head) leaves game: He took a nice shot from Gordon and was examined by the training staff. We'll update you as soon as we know more.
!,"Elfrid Payton (ankle) will not return vs. UTA: This is likely from his injury in the first half and it may have swelled up at half. In case you missed it, he slipped when he was guarding Ricky Rubio and had a fall after that. Payton was able to get back on offense and he did return, so it likely isn't serious. While he's out, we'll see more Ian Clark while Frank Jackson also got his first rotation minutes tonight. Payton finished with two rebounds, four assists and two turnovers in 16 minutes."
+,"Ball, Hart, LeBron, Kuzma, McGee will start: Coach Luke Walton likes the idea of splitting up LeBron and Rondo, which is great for Lonzo. Starting is great for his fantasy value, as it should earn him more playing time."
0,"Canaan, Jackson, Ariza, Ryno, Ayton starting: Anderson was probable with a hip issue, but he should see more minutes with Josh Jackson shifting to guard. Still, Anderson isn't part of the long-term plans and likely won't get many shots unless he's hot."
0,"Elfrid Payton returns to game in 2nd quarter: He went to the locker room and was stretching his leg on the bench after that, so it's likely another cramping issue for the second night in a row."
!,"Elfrid Payton goes to the locker room: He did have a cramping issue yesterday and it could be that again. Payton was guarding Ricky Rubio had slipped on a step, and then he fell under the basket. He jogged slowly to get to the offensive side of the floor, then checked out and went to the locker room. If he can't return, we'll see more Ian Clark to play off the ball."
0,"Joel Embiid (ankle) will play Saturday night: Embiid was a game-time decision after rolling his ankle in practice on Friday. He warmed up and got the go-ahead to be able to play. Coach Brett Brown was optimistic in his pregame press conference and also said he thought Embiid's X-rays were negative. There's no word on whether or not he'll be limited, but hopefully he can be effective either way."
!,"Devin Booker won't play, doing light shooting: He had a sleeve on his left leg and may have done some other on-court work before this game. Booker is only day-to-day after his Wednesday hammy pull and hopefully he can make it back out there next week. Josh Jackson should get the start and would see huge minutes while one of the rookie PGs gets some burn."
+,"Reggie Bullock will start against Boston: He was called probable for this shoulder issue, but he should be ready to roll for a full workload. With Luke Kennard out, Bullock should see extra minutes with plenty of treys, so he's worth a look in standard leagues."
-,Jakob Poeltl to the bench: He is not on coach Gregg Popovich's good side and it may take time for him to get the system down. Leave Poeltl on the wire.
0,"Rudy Gay coming off the bench on Saturday: He's started in the first four games of the season, so it's likely a matchup move against the up-tempo Lakers. Assuming the Spurs aren't up to something, Gay should still see minutes in the 24-28 range in a fantasy-friendly matchup"
0,"Dante Cunningham in the starting lineup: He's been moving in and out of the starting lineup, but Cunningham managed just three points in 29 minutes in his start on Monday. He's only a tourney DFS play in hopes he can rack up boards or make easy shots."
0,"Davis Bertans, Dante Cunningham start vs. LAL: Bertans and Cunningham will be joined by Bryn Forbes, DeMar DeRozan, and LaMarcus Aldridge in the starting unit. Coach Gregg Popovich hasn't been shy with switching up his starting lineup so far this season and tonight is no exception with Rudy Gay moving to the bench. Bertans doesn't have much fantasy value, outside of 3-pointers, but makes for an interesting DFS punt tonight."
0,"Deandre Ayton (ankle) will play on Saturday: He was called probable from some ankle soreness, which he suffered in practice a week ago. Ayton didn't look hobbled against the Lakers on Wednesday with a 22-point gem, so expect him to be a full go as he makes a case for Rookie of the Year."
0,"Marc Gasol will play on Saturday night: He suffered what looked to be a scary injury in Sacramento, but he won't need to miss a whole game here. Gasol may have this issue pop up down the line, but he gets a great matchup against the Suns with a less than 100% Deandre Ayton."
-,Dillon Brooks will come off the bench: Kyle Anderson will remain in the starting lineup and Brooks will likely back him up given the lack of depth at forward today. Brooks won't get enough volume to roster in most fantasy formats.
-,"Derrick Jones Jr. (foot) to play vs. Blazers: He has been playing some power forward this season, so his return could push Kelly Olynyk back to the bench. Jones Jr. has shown flashes in the young season, but he's been foul prone and likely won't do enough to matter in most leagues."
-,"Wayne Ellington will play on Saturday: It'll be his season debut from this nagging issue that has bothered him since the start of camp. Ellington may not have a clear path to big minutes because of Rodney McGruder's strong start, so leave him on the wire."
+,"Julius Randle in the starting lineup for AD: Randle was probable, but he has been probable before with his plantar fascia injury. With AD out, Randle should be asked to create offense out of the post, but the bad news is he gets Rudy Gobert down on the block. Still, he should see more run and could have an increased usage rate to up his ceiling in DFS."
!,"Anthony Davis (elbow) will not play Saturday: Wow. Davis suffered the injury on Friday night and it didn't bother him until it flared up on him after the game. It is to his shooting elbow, so perhaps that is a factor in keeping AD out against one of the better teams in the West. The Pelicans play again in Denver, so consider The Brow questionable for that one. With him out, the Pelicans will move Julius Randle into the starting lineup next to Nikola Mirotic while Cheick Diallo or Jahlil Okafor could back them up."
-,"Justise Winslow will play on Saturday: Winslow had a setback to his hammy this week and it cost him more time, so the Heat will undoubtedly take it easy on him. With Rodney McGruder playing lights out, Winslow may not get to 20 minutes in his return."
!,"Russ Westbrook (shoulder) questionable Sunday: He did not practice today due to the soreness in his shoulder, and the Thunder will not have a shootaround tomorrow. That means Westbrook is likely headed for a game-time decision for the 7:00 EDT start time. If he can't go , Dennis Schroder would likely start while Hamidou Diallo could see more run after an impressive week."
!,"Tony Parker (rest) will not play vs. 76ers: He did suffer a minor hand injury on Friday, but the team says it's rest in a back-to-back set. Parker lit it up in that win over the Bulls with 18 points, so there will be some opportunity for the Hornets guards. Devonte Graham could get his first chance at rotation minutes, or maybe Malik Monk slots in as a backup PG because he handles the ball for the second unit quite a bit. This news also helps out Jeremy Lamb and Nicolas Batum."
!,"Kevin Love (foot) out; Sam Dekker starting: That makes it two games in a row for Love with his foot soreness. The Cavs are the only 0-5 team in the NBA and it may not be long before they start to tank it up. With Love out, that'll add more volume to the other scorers on the team, so maybe Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton, Larry Nance and J.R. Smith could have more shots. Love's fantasy outlook isn't the best right now."
+,"Sam Dekker getting the starting: The Cavs aren't going to start Channing Frye again and maybe they even rest him. Neither Dekker or Frye are reliable fantasy plays unless you're looking for a tourney punt in DFS, but Larry Nance could benefit even though he's played center."
!,"Joel Embiid (ankle) will be a game-time call: He's going on the court at around the time of this news to warmup for the game tonight, so we should get an update at around 6:30 EDT. Embiid rolled his ankle at practice on Friday and there's not much known on the severity of his ailment. If he can't go, Amir Johnson would likely get the start while Jonah Bolden should see minutes. Ben Simmons and the whole rotation would have to shoot more to replace The Process' 31.7 usage rate, too."
-,"Daniel Theis (foot sprain) available to play: No word on if he will suit up, but he has a good chance with Aron Baynes (hamstring) not out there for this one. Theis isn't worth owning in most leagues while Al Horford is healthy."
!,"Anthony Davis (elbow) is a game-time call: Coach Alvin Gentry said he won't know AD's availability for tonight until after warmups, so we likely won't have much time before the 7:00 EDT tip time. Davis did hurt his elbow last night, but it didn't start to flare up until after he left the arena. If he can't go, Julius Randle and Nikola Mirotic would get a few more minutes while Cheick Diallo could get into the rotation. There would be more shots for Jrue Holiday and basically the entire rotation, too."
!,"Markieff Morris (illness) misses practice: He looked fine on Friday in 37 minutes against the Kings with 13 points and he picked up a tech for getting in Buddy Hield's face, so maybe this is the first day he's dealing with the illness. The Wizards are in Los Angeles for Sunday night against the Clippers, so he could be a game-time decision. If he can't go, Jeff Green and Kelly Oubre would get more run."
!,"Rodions Kurucs (ankle) still out: His ankle tweak from last weekend will now hold him out for at least a week. Kuruc had a terrific preseason, but it may be tough for him to get minutes now that Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is back."
0,"Rajon Rondo expected to come off bench: With Lonzo Ball staying the starting lineup, it should be Rajon Rondo shifting to a bench role. Rondo is back after a three-game absence today and his minutes likely take a hit with this news, but the pace of the Lakers may be enough to buoy his value in some formats."
+,"ESPN: Lonzo Ball to remain in starting lineup: The Lakers played their best two games of the season as they earned a win in Phoenix and beating the Nuggets at Staples Center, so coach Luke Walton will carry that momentum even with Rajon Rondo returning from his suspension. Ball's defense was outstanding and his transition game fits the identity of the team. This is terrific news for his fantasy value and he should see minutes next to Rondo, as well."
!,"Anthony Davis (elbow) questionable vs. Utah: The Pelicans put out an injury report earlier today, but they just added AD to this new one in the afternoon. Davis did finish his game on Friday and played 38 minutes, but he had his worst shooting game of the season with a 6-of-19 shooting line. If this shooting-elbow problem is still bothering him, maybe the Pelicans sit him in a back-to-back set. If he can't go, there will be plenty of shots to go around while Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle have their minutes extended. We would likely see some Cheick Diallo, as well."
-,"Luc Mbah a Moute (knee) questionable Sunday: Mbah a Moute did not play against the Rockets on Friday due to the knee injury. He is averaging just 5.0 points and 1.8 rebounds in 15.3 minutes this season, so he should be left on waivers in all fantasy leagues. Montrezl Harrell has been on fire of late. Over the Clippers last three games, Harrell is averaging 19.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 2.3 blocks in 24.9 minutes. He should see again plenty of playing time on Sunday if Mbah a Moute is ruled out. Mike Scott would also play increased minutes."
!,"James Johnson (groin) ruled out Saturday: Johnson has been practicing with the team this week, but has not yet been cleared to make his season debut. JJ played through a nagging hernia injury in 2017-18, and it was partly responsible for his dip in production. He averaged 10.9 points and 4.8 rebounds and shot 30.8 percent on 3-pointers last season. Thus, it could be that Miami is erring on the side of caution and waiting until he is fully healed before allowing him to play in a game."
!,"Russell Westbrook (shoulder) doesn't practice: Westbrook missed the first two games of the season while recovering from knee surgery, but has looked healthy in each of OKC's last two contests. He tallied 13 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and five turnovers in 32 minutes on Thursday night vs. Boston. It's unknown if Russ injured his shoulder in that game or in practice on Friday. Also, Donovan did not specify which shoulder Westbrook injured. If Russ is ruled out Sunday, Dennis Schroder would draw the start at PG and would be a popular DFS target."
0,"Josh Jackson likely to start on Saturday: Jackson has struggled mightily this season. Over the Suns last three games, Jackson is averaging 5.0 points, 1.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 3.0 turnovers, while shooting just 27.3 percent from the floor, 20 percent from 3-point territory and 33.3 percent from the free-throw line. He did average 15/5/2 in the 35 games he started last season, so hopefully, he snaps out of his slump on Saturday."
-,"Ryan Anderson (hip) upgraded to qustionable: Anderson is expected to suit up on Saturday, but he has been inefficient and ineffective this season. He is currently averaging just 5.5 points and 3.5 rebounds in 21.5 minutes, while shooting a putrid 36.0 percent from the floor and 20 percent from downtown."
+,"Deandre Ayton (ankle) upgraded to probable: Ayton tweaked his ankle last week, but it has not been an issue for him. He tallied 22 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and three blocks on Wednesday. On the season, he is averaging 16.3 points (on 62.8 percent shooting), 10.8 boards and 3.8 assists. With Devin Booker (hamstring) sidelined on Saturday, Ayton should see even more touches on the offensive end and could post his highest usage rate of the season."
+,"Elfrid Payton (leg) not on injury report: Payton was cramping up at the end of Friday's game vs. Brooklyn, but it is clearly just a minor issue. He will be ready to rock Saturday vs. the Jazz. Elf is off to an excellent start this season, averaging 14.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists."
!,"Darius Miller (quad) ruled out Saturday: Miller injured his quad Friday night in the Pelicans victory over the Nets and was unable to return to the contest. On the season, he is averaging 3.8 points and 1.5 assists in 15.0 minutes. Wes Johnson and Solomon Hill should see an uptick in minutes with Miller sidelined."
0,"Julius Randle (foot) probable Saturday: Randle is dealing with plantar fasciitis in his left foot but it hasn't slowed him down. He scored 14 points with seven rebounds, three assists, one steal, two blocks and two turnovers in 23 minutes on Friday night. For the season, he is averaging 17.5 points, 8.5 rebounds, and a career-high 1.0 treys in 23.3 minutes."
-,"Derrick Jones Jr. (foot) still probable Sat: Jones did not play Wednesday vs. the Knicks but is expected to return to action on Saturday. However, both Justise Winslow (sore right hamstring) and Wayne Ellington (ankle) are also probable for this contest. As a result, Jones will likely see his playing time reduced significantly going forward."
-,"Justise Winslow (hamstring) remains probable: Derrick Jones Jr., Wayne Ellington and Winslow all remain probable for Saturday's contest. Winslow has yet to make his 2018-19 debut. In 2017-18, he averaged 7.8 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.2 assists. He is not worth rostering in most fantasy formats."
0,"Sam Dekker may start Saturday if Love out: Channing Frye started Thursday in place of Love on Thursday and tallied five points and four rebounds in 21 minutes. Larry Nance logged 28 minutes off the bench and finished with 11 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. Dekker did not play Thursday. He is averaging 5.0 points and 3.3 rebounds in 10.8 minutes over his four appearances this season."
!,"Daniel Theis (foot) questionable Saturday: Theis has appeared in four of the Celtics five games this season and is averaging 3.3 points and 2.3 rebounds in 10.5 minutes. Aron Baynes (hamstring) has already been ruled out, so the C's may be a bit shorthanded up front. If Theis is unable to play, Marcus Morris and Guerschon Yabusele would soak up additional minutes."
!,"Aron Baynes (hamstring) ruled out Saturday: Coach Brad Stevens said the team is holding out Baynes just to be conservative. Baynes said he does not feel hamstring pain, stating: 'If it was playoff time there would be no doubt.' The Celtics next game is Tuesday in Boston, and it would appear Baynes has a good chance to suit up for that contest. Daniel Theis (foot) is questionable for Saturday. If he is unable to play, Guerschon Yabusele would likely see an uptick in minutes. Marcus Morris will also log additional playing time Saturday."
!,"Elfrid Payton says he had cramping in leg: Payton needed to be attended to by trainers as he sat on the court in the fourth quarter on Friday night, but it seemed evident that it as only a cramp issue. Elfrid Payton scored 17 points with five rebounds, six assists and one 3-pointer in 31 minutes vs. the Nets and will look to continue the hot start to his season Saturday night."
-,"Devin Harris (hamstring) making progress: Harris hasn't played since the season opener, but is headed in the right direction. 'He's doing well,' Carlisle said. 'He's getting better gradually every day. I don't know when he'll play. It might be sooner than I thought. I think Sunday is very doubtful, but I just don't know. The injury wasn't a serious injury. Hey, when you're 35, you know your body and you got to step back and get treatment for a while until you don't feel it anymore. That's what we went through with Harrison. I'm hopeful it's sooner than later.' Even when fully healthy, Harris is not on the fantasy radar."
0,"John Wall and Bradley Beal call out teammates: The Wiz dropped to 1-4 on the season Friday night and tension appears to be building in the locker room. 'Weve got guys thats worried about whos getting shots. You should never worry about that,' said Wall. Brad Beal also had some harsh comments: 'Sometimes, we have our own agendas on the floor, whether its complaining about shots, complaining about playing time, complaining about whatever it may be.' Neither player mentioned Otto Porter by name, but coach Scott Brooks did, saying Porter 'cant worry about' his shots. Yikes. The Wizards next game is Sunday vs. the Clippers."
!,"Kevin Love (foot) questionable for Saturday: Love missed multiple preseason games due to lingering soreness in his left foot and then, after struggling through the first four games of the regular season, he was ruled out of Thursday's contest vs. Detroit. Channing Frye started Thursday and tallied five points and four rebounds in 21 minutes. Larry Nance logged 28 minutes off the bench and finished with 11 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. Nance is worth DFS consideration if Love is ruled out Saturday."
+,"Reggie Bullock (shoulder) probable Saturday: Bullock had a dud on Thursday night (five points on 2-of-10 shooting) but was averaging 16.5 points over his first two games of the year. It seems a slight shoulder injury may have been part of the reason. Nonetheless, With Luke Kennard (shoulder) sidelined and Stanley Johnson playing poorly, Bullock is locked into heavy minutes and should continue to provide value in deep leagues."
!,"Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) plans to play Sunday: Smith tweaked his ankle in Wednesday's game vs. Atlanta and played with a noticeable limp in that contest. He was expected to suit up Friday vs. the Raptors but was ruled out. Smith warmed up prior to the game, but said his ankle didn't feel right. We'll consider him questionable for now, and should expect an update after Sunday morning's shootaround."
+,"Buddy Hield scores 22 points on 8-of-17 FGs: This was on the heels of a 23-point effort on Wednesday, so Hield is heating up. He's very efficient for a SG and was hitting 50.7 from the field prior to Friday, and he kept that trend going with 8-of-17 shots tonight. He has a shot at mid-round value this season, especially if he can get his steals up (he only has one through six games)."
+,"De'Aaron Fox scores 18 points in win: It was quite a night for Fox with some sound defense and several highlights which included a crossover that put Austin Rivers on skates. His turnovers and FT% haven't improved since his rookie season just yet, but his FG% has gone up considerably -- he hit 7-of-14 shots tonight and is now hitting 47.4% on the season compared to 41.2% as a rookie."
+,"Nemanja Bjelica drops 26 points vs. Wizards: He finished four points away from his career-high (30), and this was his third career game with 20+ points. Bjelica added 12 rebounds to complete his double-double with three assists, one steal, one block and six triples in 36 minutes. He was worth owning before this explosion and is now sitting inside the top-25 for 9-category rankings. Temper your expectations though, as the Kings will eventually take a longer look at their younger guys."
-,"Iman Shumpert plays 17 minutes in return: He was actually playing pretty well before the injury, but he's never been a reliable fantasy contributor and his rest-of-season outlook is pretty bleak on such a young roster."
-,"Jeff Green scores 13 points vs. Kings: He played 27 minutes and closed this game alongside Kelly Oubre with Otto Porter struggling, hitting 5-of-8 shots and a pair of free throws. The Wizards are shorthanded right now and coach Scott Brooks has been using smaller lineups, so Green has seen a nice bump in value. He has played 24 or more minutes in four out of five games, but he's still just a deep-league asset for now."
+,"Kelly Oubre scores 22 points vs. Kings: With Otto Porter struggling again, coach Scott Brooks turned to Oubre and Jeff Green. Oubre added nine rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block and five 3-pointers, and he's now played 29 or more minutes in three straight with averages of 20.3 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.7 triples in that span. Oubre's value could trend down if Porter figures things out or when Dwight Howard (back) returns, but he has to be owned right now."
-,"Otto Porter benched down the stretch: He played 22 minutes and has now seen less than 25 minutes of action in three out of five games. Kelly Oubre had the hot hand with 22 points and has been impressive with three straight games of 17+ points, and coach Scott Brooks has been rolling with Jeff Green an awful lot too. Porter's value is too low to trade right now, so fantasy owners just have to hope that he turns things around soon."
-,"Ian Mahinmi (back) plays 19 minutes in loss: The Wizards really like their small-ball lineup with Markieff Morris at the five, so Mahinmi isn't going to get much run even with Dwight Howard (back) out. He can be left on the wire pretty much everywhere."
+,"Bradley Beal scores 21 points in loss: This was his second game of the season with at least 39 minutes and his third with at least 35. This was Beal's first bad shooting performance of the season, as he hit just 6-of-19 shots after hitting 50.6% in his previous for games. He was a true-game time call tonight, so maybe the injury held him back a bit. He's a top-5 fantasy SG and should get back on track vs. the Clippers on Sunday."
+,"John Wall scores 26, Wizards fall to 1-4: It still wasn't enough though, as the Wizards imploded late and fell to 1-4 on the season. He came into tonight's game shooting 41.3% from the field and 68.4% from the line, but it was never a concern for him. 'It takes time. It is what it is. I know Im putting in all the work in and preparing myself for every game,' Wall said. 'Youre not going to make every shot. You just got to go there and be confident.' We'll see if Wall and the Wizards can get a result in Los Angeles vs. the Clippers on Sunday, but a lot of Washington fans are already panicking."
0,"John Henson scores nine points vs. Wolves: He's playing just above 17.0 minutes per game on the season and won't have consistent value while Brook Lopez is healthy. On a side note, it's nice to see Henson expanding his range, as he's now shooting 5-of-11 from beyond the arc on the season. This makes him even more intriguing if Lopez ever picked up an injury."
+,"Eric Bledsoe scores six points in blowout: He played just 21 minutes because of the blowout, finishing with a +21 in his limited action. Even with this dud factored in, Bledsoe is cruising with top-35 value in standard leagues and comfortably beating his ADP."
+,"Giannis Antetokounmpo scores 15 points: The Wolves were in shambles and the Bucks built a 30-point lead entering the fourth quarter, so Giannis took an early seat after 23 minutes. His efficiency hasn't been the best so far in the young season, but his counting stats are off the charts once again, especially his rebounding -- he's posting a career-high 20.5 rebounding percentage, up from 14.1% last season. It's scary how good this guy could be."
-,"Matthew Dellavedova scores six points: He got some burn in garbage time with the game well out of reach. If Delly is on your fantasy team, you can log off until next season."
0,Thon Maker makes season debut: He cleaned up in garbage time with the Bucks up by 30 points entering the fourth quarter. Maker is comfortably behind Brook Lopez and John Henson and there's no indication that that will change any time soon. We're taking him off the injury report after a knee issue limited him for a couple weeks.
-,"Karl-Anthony Towns scores 16 in ugly loss: These are dark days for KAT's owners, and he didn't even touch the floor in the fourth with Minnesota trailing by 30. Outside of blocks and FT%, his numbers are way down across the board. His fantasy owners just need to hang in there and hope KAT's situation improves when Jimmy Butler is inevitably traded."
+,"Anthony Davis with 18-14, 4 steals, 5 blocks: He became the 94th player to join the NBA's 1,000 blocks club in this win, and AD has the last two performances in the NBA of at least 18 points, 14 rebounds, four steals and five blocks because of course he does. Yeah, AD is scoring a bunch at 27.3 points per game with 13.3 boards to go with it, but his 3.8 blocks and 2.5 steals are what really separates him from the bunch. If you passed on AD and he stays healthy, it's going to sting all season when you look at his stat lines."
-,"Jeff Teague held to four points in loss: He missed all five of his 3-pointers and couldn't salvage his line with four assists and two rebounds. Teague, Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler and Josh Okogie all had a +/- rating of -23 or worse, and they scored a combined 28 points. The Wolves are a mess right now, but Teague's owners shouldn't overreact."
+,"Jrue Holiday scores season-high 26 points: It was only a matter of time before he busted out of his three-game slump to start the year. Holiday also hit a game-winning jumper to keep the Pelicans as the only undefeated team in the West. The Pelicans continue to push the pace and that will set up a lot of easy transition buckets for Holiday, so expect him to be a helpful contributor in FG%. If you bought low on him this week, well done."
0,"Jimmy Butler (illness) held to four points: He probably should've sat this one out, but as you know, that's not his thing. The trade rumors have started to intensify again, and coach Tom Thibodeau addressed them at the morning shootaround. 'You just got to do what's right,' Thibs said. 'To me, it's like, if something is a good deal and you think you're getting good value, you have to do what's right for the franchise.' A trade is more likely to go down when Marquese Chriss and Brandon Knight are eligible to be moved on Oct. 31, but you never know in the NBA."
0,"Julius Randles scores 14 points vs. Nets: He continues to just set up shop in the paint and he's meshed nicely with Anthony Davis, as well. Randle is dealing with a minor plantar fascia issue and he was probable today, so hopefully things don't get worse for him."
0,"Elfrid Payton has cramps late: He did suffer what looks to be a minor leg injury at the end of the game, but  after the game he said it was just cramps. Payton has done well in this up-tempo offense and looks like a solid value from drafts."
+,"D'Angelo Russell drops 24 with costly late TO: Things were going about as well as they could have, but Russell had a careless turnover with 7.5 seconds left to give the Pelicans the ball back and allow Jrue Holiday to win the game on the next possession. Russell has been hot for two games in a row now, and coach Kenny Atkinson likely won't punish him for just a lapse of judgment. He's trending up after a slow start."
+,"Caris LeVet scores 21 points in 31 minutes: The efficiency was not there, but Jrue Holiday has held countless All-Star guards in check. LeVert continues to show his grasp of the offense, his usage rate remains high, and he's really grown as a distributor to go with his explosive scoring style. While he has taken a step back after those off-the-charts two games to start, LeVert is still on track to be one of the best values on draft day."
+,"Danny Green stays hot w/ 15 points, four 3s: He has found the form that made him a fantasy star back in 2014-15. Green is churning out top-40 value in 9-category leagues right now because of his 3-pointers (3.0), steals (1.0) and blocks (1.2), all while leading the Raptors in net rating (+19.8). He was flying off the waiver wire last week, but he's more than likely long gone in competitive leagues."
+,"Jarrett Allen fills the stat sheet vs. AD: The scoring wasn't there, but Allen had one of his better games of the season from a defensive standpoint. Plus, only two fouls against Anthony Davis while keeping AD in check overall. In fact, all 28 of Allen's minutes came against AD and The Brow made just 5-of-18 from the field. Plus, the dimes and steals are showing up for Allen, so he'll be just fine as a breakout candidate."
0,"Pascal Siakam plays 37 minutes in win: He hit 4-of-8 shots and a pair of free throws, but missed his two 3-point attempts. The Raptors were missing three guys tonight including OG Anunoby (personal), so we can't read too much into the spike in minutes -- he was averaging 20.6 minutes per game before Friday. He is second on the Raptors in net rating (+17.8) and will earn an expanded role if he keeps it up, so he's a decent stash at the end of standard-league rosters."
0,"Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  scores just four: The Nets went super small for long stretches in this game and coach Kenny Atkinson isn't quite ready to take the limits off Hollis-Jefferson. It should happen in the near future, so his owners should be hanging in there in all formats."
+,Kyle Lowry scores 20 w/ 12 assists in win: He now has 10+ assists in four straight games for the first time in his career and has led the Raptors to their first 6-0 start in franchise history. He's cruising right now and has been the 7th best player in 9-category leagues. He'll draw a matchup with Eric Bledsoe and the Bucks on Monday.
-,"Shabazz Napier scores 16 points: The Nets went super small again as Napier got hot in the second half, but both D'Angelo Russell and Caris LeVert were back to close. Napier is going to be too inconsistent to own in most leagues."
+,"Montrezl Harrell scores career-high 30 points: Revenge game? In Sunday's win over the Rockets, Harrell said revenge wasn't a factor, but could've fooled us with this one and a 17-point gem on Sunday as the Clippers won both. For tonight, Harrell lived in the paint and cleaned up at the line, making 14-of-15 from the stripe. Harrell had 21 and five at the end of the third thanks to playing the final 17 minutes in the first half and just taking over to close the third. He may not start, but there's no way Harrell can remain on the waiver wire with now three straight outstanding games."
-,"Pat Beverley gets 17 minutes: Foul trouble got him and the flow of the game kept him out. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hasn't looked like a rookie on either end and he's already shown he can switch in the NBA's PNR-happy style, so Beverley may need a trade to revive his fantasy value."
0,"Jonas Valanciunas scores 17 points in start: He was back in the starting lineup to match up with DeAndre Jordan, one of the last few non-shooting bigs in the NBA. 'Dying,' J-Val said of centers who can't shoot. 'The big guy's dying.' For context, that's one of the reasons why J-Val has spent so much time trying to expand his range. J-Val is only averaging 20.3 minutes as a starter compared to 18.0 minutes as a reserve, so the starting designation doesn't change his value too much. He will likely be back on the bench for Monday's matchup vs. Brook Lopez and the Bucks, but then back in the first unit for Tuesday's game vs. Joel Embiid's 76ers."
-,"Marcin Gortat doesn't score: Montrezl Harrell may not start, but it's abundantly clear he is the man. Drop Gortat, assuming you haven't already."
0,"SGA scores 10 in 31 minutes: The three-guard lineups were out in force today. Gilgeous-Alexander has likely already has closed the gap on Pat Beverley, and finding minutes at the three adds to his floor in most matchups. It's still going to take some times before you're really excited about putting SGA in your lineup, but you're going to have to wait because there will be a long line to put a claim in on him if he's dropped."
-,"Dorian Finney-Smith comes off the bench: Harrison Barnes was limited to 28 minutes, but should be over 30+ soon. DFS is an easy cut in deeper leagues and is probably looking at minutes in the teens going forward."
-,"Milos Teodosic makes his debut: He was in there for the first half as coach Doc Rivers mixed it up. It was a surprise to see him in there as the Clippers went heavy with three-guard lineups. If Luc Mbah a Moute (knee) is out, maybe Milos will stay in the rotation, but this could've been about the matchup against the smaller Rockets lineups."
-,"Jalen Brunson scores eight points in start: It wasn't pretty and he was scoreless in the first half, but Brunson did settle into his role down the stretch. He finished 3-of-11 from the field and turned the ball over twice. It doesn't sound like Dennis Smith Jr.'s ankle injury is serious and he was a late scratch tonight, so there's no need to grab Brunson in most leagues. When Dallas is healthy, the rookie is still behind both DSJ and J.J. Barea, but coach Rick Carlisle wanted to keep his second unit together tonight."
+,"Lou Wiliams scores 23 points in 26 minutes: He looked like he would've easily hit 30 after he had 19 in the first half, but the Clippers ran away from the Rockets and they didn't need Williams down the stretch. Before the game, coach Doc Rivers said he wants Lou to drive more, so Williams could get back to his high-scoring ways we saw last season."
0,"Harrison Barnes scores 14 points in return: Some rust is to be expected after a lengthy absence, but Barnes was moving well and should be back over 30+ minutes in no time. He's been the Mavs primary go-to scorer the last two seasons and he doesn't think that will change with a stronger supporting cast around him. 'My job is to go out there and be aggressive offensively and defensively,' Barnes said. 'I pretty much am used to adapting, so I dont see my role changing too much.' Even with Luka Doncic around, Barnes has a clear path to mid-round value."
+,"DeAndre Jordan scores 18 w/ 15 rebounds: He was 5-of-10 from the field and has suddenly turned into Dirk Nowitzki from the line this season -- he hit 8-of-9 free throws and is now shooting 84.6% on the season (22-of-26). That would obliterate his previous career-high of 58%, so it might be a little foolish to expect this pace the rest of the way. He still deserves a ton of credit for turning things around in his age-30 season and he's been awesome for the Mavs so far."
-,Michael Carter-WIlliams scores 10: He played the last six minutes of garbage time to boost his stats slightly. He's pretty much unaffected by the James Harden injury because Carter-Williams is functionally a wing in this rotation. Leave him on the wire in most leagues
0,"Eric Gordon struggles vs. Clippers: The first unit came out flat and Gordon couldn't do anything in his minutes staggered away from Chris Paul, making 3-of-14 from the field. He'll get another chance to produce without James Harden (hamstring) in the mix, so expect a much better game on Tuesday."
+,"Luka Doncic scores 22 points in loss to TOR: People were actually worried that Doncic's offense wouldn't translate because he's not the greatest athlete, but he just dropped 22 points with the NBA's best defender in Kawhi Leonard guarding him. Doncic has now scored 19+ points in four out of five games, and it was a relief to see him knock down all four of his free throws tonight after shooting 61.9% from the line prior to Friday. He'll get the Jazz on Sunday in Dallas."
0,"Gerald Green scores 19 points vs. Clips: He probably likes garbage time more than Christmas with 10 points in the fourth. Green will have another chance to produce with James Harden (hamstring) out at least one more, but this 19-point game probably wouldn't have got your attention had it been a close contest."
+,"Frank Ntilikina scores 17 in start at PG: Things were going well for the Knicks, then the fourth quarter happened when they were outscored 47-16. Ntilikina had some trouble on Steph Curry, but this was a win for Ntilikina's outlook. Before the game, coach David Fizdale explained himself on why he was starting Franky Smokes. 'I want to see him in a lot of different capacities and see which one fits best, which one he might impact winning the best at,' Fizdale said. He also said he doesn't want to put a cap on his guard and he's going to take his time. There will be some ups and downs for the raw French guard, but he could still be worth a look if you're looking for a mystery box to add to your roster."
+,"Draymond Green scores 18 vs. Knicks: That's more like it. Green was only shooting 37.9% from the field and 66.7% from the line prior to Friday, so it was nice to see improvement there (7-of-8 FGs, 2-of-2 FTs). His turnovers (4) are still an issue, but with Green you just have to take the good with the bad. He'll have another favorable matchup vs. the Nets on Sunday."
0,"Mitchell Robinson plays 29 minutes in start: The Knicks were up in the early fourth, so this wasn't garbage time despite the 28-point loss. He only committed two fouls and didn't look out of place against the NBA's best team. The Knicks have said they wanted to get Robinson some time in the G League to get him going, but maybe they'll change course given his performance in a start. Odds are he will be a headache to own in the near future, so he's more of a stash in weekly leagues or if adding him now doesn't hurt you."
-,"Damyean Dotson plays well in start: He's clearly the guy that has stepped in to Kevin Knox's role while the rookie recovers from an ankle injury. Coach David Fizdale's rotation is a complete mess right now, so it's tough to tell how long Dotson will be the guy. He's more of a deep-league pickup because he'll lose run when Knox returns next month."
+,"Stephen Curry scores 29 points vs. Knicks: According to Warriors PR, his six-game streak with at least five 3-pointers is the longest such streak ever to begin a season. He hit 10-of-18 shots and 3-of-3 free throws, and he was well on his way to a monster night before Kevin Durant took over late with 25 of his 41 points in the fourth quarter. Curry is second to only Anthony Davis in 9-category leagues right now and just needs to stay healthy."
0,"Noah Vonleh scores seven points in start: He was in the mix to start at center over Mitchell Robinson, but it turns out he started next to him. Vonleh has played more center than power forward, and chances are he'll go back into that role the next time out. This is a very fluid situation, so most owners may want to steer clear until it's not so murky. He could emerge as a stash if the Knicks sell off players."
0,"Klay Thompson's struggles continue: He hit just 6-of-18 shots and missed all four of his 3-pointers. He's been particularly bad from deep this season, hitting just 4-of-31 (12.9%) attempts through six games. The shot attempts are still there with at least 14 over his last four games, and it's just a matter of time before one of the NBA's best shooters gets back into a rhythm. There's some obvious buy-low appeal here."
-,"Lance Thomas scores two off the bench: Coach David Fizdale has compared Thomas to Draymond Green, so it's a fun coincidence that he came off the bench in this one. Thomas doesn't offer enough fantasy upside when the Knicks can suit up at least eight guys."
-,Mario Hezonja scores six off bench: He was -16 in 18 minutes. His role hasn't really changed much since Kevin Knox (ankle) went down with Damyean Dotson firmly ahead of him right now. Hezonja should be dropped in most leagues and/or swapped for Dotson.
+,"Kevin Durant scores 41 points in win at MSG: This game was tight entering the fourth, but KD blew the lid off the arena with 25 of his points in the quarter (a career-high for points in a quarter). There was a lot of attention on KD because the Knicks are making him their top priority in free agency next summer, and he obviously loves playing at MSG, calling it a 'playground with walls.' KD has said himself that he's not looking beyond 2018-19, so we won't read too much into any of the chatter. As for fantasy, KD has been unfair over his last two games, shooting a combined 30-of-42 from the field."
-,"Enes Kanter comes off the bench: He may not have been happy about the move to the bench and tweeted out one period after the lineup was announced. Any OKC fan will tell you that Kanter has been run off the floor against the Warriors, so that could have been a factor for coach David Fizdale. Kanter will undoubtedly have strong games, but the Knicks looking to tank later in the year could be a potential pitfall to his fantasy value."
+,Bradley Beal (chest) will start against Kings: He was a game-time decision and the Wizards took this one right up until the lineups were announced. Beal did not shootaround in this game and it'll be interesting to see how this affects his shot or contact on drives. You're obviously starting him in all formats.
-,"Trey Burke scores 15 points in 22 minutes: Frank Ntilikina was pretty solid as an offensive player in this game, so maybe the Knicks will want to look at him a little more in the first unit. Either way, Burke was only shooting 38.7% from the field before today and it looks like that stretch-run finish last season looks like a fluke. He's a drop in most standard formats."
+,"Kemba Walker scores 30 points in 26 minutes: The Hornets are on a back-to-back set, so coach James Borrego didn't need to play his star point guard in the fourth quarter. Walker continues to control the flow of the offense and was among the league leaders with his 8.5 minutes in time of possession, and his usage rate may actually be able to hold around 30 -- he's at a 31.4 usage rate with a 64.0 TS%.  If you drafted him in the second round, it looks like you hit a home run. If you drafted him in the third, you may want to consider a tougher league."
-,Marvin Williams gets 17 minutes: The competition is getting intense at the four with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Miles Bridges coming for Marvin's minutes. Wiliams is looking like a drop in most leagues.
-,"Tony Parker scores 18 points vs. Bulls: He did hurt his right hand at the end of the second quarter, but he came back and obviously looked fine.  Parker continues to see minutes next to Kemba Walker and he's adapted to his off-ball game quite well. Still, he's more of a 16-team player to own."
0,"Willy not going to be freed: With Michael Kidd-Gilchrist almost locked in as a five at times, there just isn't enough of a chance for Hernangomez right now. Free Willy will have to come at some other point this season."
-,"MKG continues to log minutes at C: The Hornets are really leaning on MKG at the five and that is likely going to continue regardless of matchup. Since the opener, coach James Borrego has wanted to play MKG at the five after its play in the fourth, so maybe Kidd-Gilchrist can get to 25 minutes. Still, he isn't much of a stat-stuffing forward, so he's not quite 12-team material."
+,"Miles Bridges scores 15 points in 26 minutes: Here comes Bridges and this wasn't all about garbage time. He was the first sub off the bench and his energy is something that will get him on coach James Borrego's good side. The Hornets really like going small, which could be the move that gets Bridges minutes i the 20s. If your league is competitive with pickups, it's probably time to grab him in 12-team leagues."
-,"Iman Shumpert 'intends to play' Friday: Barring a setback in warmups or some shadiness from the Kings, Shumpert will return from a one-game absence. He's averaging 22.0 minutes per game and only has value in very deep leagues for the time being."
+,"Zach LaVine scores 20 points in 26 minutes: He faced some much tougher defense in this game, but still his efficiency wasn't too bad thanks to the treys. LaVine has always been capable of blowing by his perimeter defenders and his ability to finish has taken his game to another level. Garbage time was also a factor in the front end of a back-to-back set, so LaVine likely would've scored over 25 in a close game. He'll be just fine as one of the breakout scorers this season."
0,"Wendell Carter Jr. scores seven with two BKs: He has been overmatched on defense, and he's committed at least three fouls in each game despite playing under 24 minutes per game. Still, the Bulls have made their move on the center spot with Robin Lopez getting DNP-CDs, so Carter should start to figure out how to defend the paint in the near future. He's a buy-low option and he also hit his first trey today."
+,"Cameron Payne scores 15 points in loss: He was hot to start the game, but there was just too much Kemba Walker to take the Bulls out of this one. Payne has done more than enough to show he should deserve close to 30 minutes at the point-guard spot, and he's suddenly a capable shooter from deep -- probably not sustainable. Regardless, he should be owned in standard leagues with what should be at least four weeks of production with Kris Dunn (knee) on the sidelines."
-,"Chandler Hutchison flops in start: He played the final seven minutes in garbage time, so disregard those 28 minutes. Hutchison had a bad airball on a trey from the wing and he wasn't very useful on defense either. The Bulls got destroyed in this game, so maybe Hutchison doesn't stick in the first unit for long. Leave him on the wire."
0,"Cris Felicio gets 30 minutes thanks to G time: Although, this wasn't about garbage time with Wendell Carter Jr. getting into some foul trouble. Felicio looks to be locked in as the backup center and he should get minutes in the 20s as WJC figures out the nuances of playing center in the NBA. Felicio could be a DFS punt some games in bad matchups or a deep-league option."
+,"Jabari Parker scores 19 points off the bench: Coach Fred Hoiberg said he wanted to keep Parker in the second unit and would have liked him to close, but Hoiberg may feel differently after his squad was thumped on the road. Even if Parker isn't starting, the Bulls probably can't get away with playing Chandler Hutchison big minutes, so Parker should have some increased value for the next two weeks before Lauri Markkanen (elbow) comes back."
-,"Justin Holiday scores five in 29 minutes: He didn't play in the fourth and he looks to be ticketed for a high-minute role with the Bulls being so thin. Holiday won't be getting the volume like he did last year before the Bulls shut him down, but he can hit treys, pick up some steals, he did play some four, and maybe he can get hot in the right matchup. He's not quite worth adding in shallower leagues, though."
!,"Darius Miller will not return Friday: He was deemed questionable to return at the half, but was ruled out for the night a few minutes into the third quarter. Miller finished with three points, one rebound, two assists and a triple in four minutes. We could see more of Wes Johnson and Solomon Hill in the second half."
-,"Jason Smith goes back to bench: With Ian Mahinmi (back) back in the starting lineup and the Wizards using a lot of small-ball lineups, there's a chance we don't see Smith at all tonight."
0,"Ian Mahinmi (back) will start on Friday night: He went through shootaround after missing the last game. Mahinmi isn't likely to play big minutes in what should be an up-tempo game. If he's limited, there could be more minutes for Markieff Morris, Jason Smith, Kelly Oubre and Jeff Green."
-,"Kenneth Faried out for Friday night: The team announced it in the first quarter, but Faried wasn't going to be in the rotation anyway."
-,"Jalen Brunson getting the start for DSJ: Coach Rick Carlisle called Brunson a top-15 player in the draft, so his words match his actions here. Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) could possibly miss more time, and Brunson has been solid in his time off the bench. He's only worth a flier in deep leagues for now."
0,"Jimmy Butler will start on Friday night: There is a lot going on with Jimmy and the timing of his illness certainly raises some questions. Butler should have a lot of shots coming his way with Andrew Wiggins out of the lineup, or maybe Karl-Anthony Towns can get it going."
!,"Andrew Wiggins (quad) will not play Friday: It'll be his second game out due to this injury and just the third of his career. It doesn't sound like Wiggins is going to miss time, but the Wolves aren't exactly in  their right state of mind. Josh Okogie will be getting another start and is set for big minutes."
!,"J.J. Barea available to play vs. Raptors: He could be in the starting lineup after a mild hammy strain. If he's not starting, it could be Jalen Brunson with Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) out for this one. JJB will be a popular DFS play."
!,"Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) will not play Friday: He played through an ankle tweak on Wednesday and was in visible pain after he rolled it. Smith Jr. was expected to play in this game, so hopefully it's just a precaution. This should give J.J. Barea more minutes while Wes Matthews and Luka Doncic should also benefit."
-,Dellavedova (forehead) likely to play: He has zero fantasy value right now with four total minutes on the season.
!,"Luc Mbah a Moute (left knee) will not play: He was playing some five this week, so there could be a few more minutes available for the frontcourt guys. Montrezl Harrell went off against the Rockets on Sunday and is likely going to benefit most, but coach Doc Rivers said he likes playing Danilo Gallinari at the five."
+,"Chris Paul back in the starting lineup: He has served his two-game suspension and should be ready for a huge role with James Harden (hamstring) out. CP3's usage rate and assist percentages have skyrocketed when Harden was on the bench in his time with Houston, so Paul has a massive upside tonight."
0,"Jimmy Butler and Wiggins are game-time calls: The Wolves aren't the most transparent team and you have to wonder if the Wolves will hold Butler out for trade reasons. If Butler and Wiggins can't go, we're going to see a lot of Josh Okogie and Derrick Rose."
-,"Michael Carter-Williams to the bench: Even with James Harden (hamstring) out tonight, Carter-Williams may not be asked to handle the ball much because Eric Gordon has played some point."
+,"Carmelo Anthony will start on Friday vs. LAC: With James Harden (hamstring) and his 32.3 usage rate sitting this one out, Melo is basically a lock for double-digit shot attempts and will look to build off his 22-point game on Wednesday. We don't love his season-long outlook, but Melo should be in lineups tonight."
!,"Deandre Ayton dealing with ankle soreness: This is likely just lingering effects from his ankle tweak last week. The Suns won't want this to be a problem all year, so maybe they opt to sit him even if it's minor. If he does sit Richaun Holmes would be a spot-start or DFS play."
-,"Ryan Anderson is questionable for Saturday: He did have a hip issue in March, so this is something to watch. It feels like it's just a matter of time before Anderson losses minutes, so expect him to trend down. There should be plenty of minutes available for the Suns forwards and guards.."
-,"Dennis Smith Jr. expected to play Friday: He was playing with a limp in his previous outing after tweaking an ankle, but his status was never really in doubt. We were hoping to see DSJ improve his efficiency this season, but he's currently sitting at 37.5% from the field and 75% from the line with 2.8 turnovers. Things won't get any easier vs. Kyle Lowry."
