"Dallas coach Rick Carlisle expected Luka Doncic to play on Monday vs. the Spurs. Dallas will monitor him up until tip-off, but barring a setback, he will be out there in his usual role. This makes him risky in DFS, but season-long owners can throw him into lineups."
"Updating a previous report, Andrew Wiggins (quad) will not play Monday against the Lakers. "
"Thon Maker will get a chance to play on Monday vs. the Raptors. Maker is the third center on the depth chart behind Brook Lopez and John Henson, but coach Mike Budenholzer said Maker may get an opportunity with Giannis Antetokounmpo (concussion) out. You still can't trust him in almost any fantasy league, though."
"Anfernee Simons will be available to play Monday against the Pacers. Simons hasn't been able to get into the rotation this season, but that could change tonight with Moe Harkless (knee) watching from the sidelines. We don't expect him to get enough minutes to make an impact in fantasy hoops, though."
"Norman Powell will replace Kawhi Leonard (rest) on Monday vs. the Bucks. Leonard will be back on Tuesday to take on the 76ers, so Powell is just a desperation streamer or a punt option in DFS. He wasn't effective in his last spot-start, scoring seven points with five rebounds and one 3-pointer."
"Michael Beasley (personal) will not suit up for Monday's game against the Timberwolves. He's not a part of the rotation anyway, so his playing status is irrelevant in fantasy hoops."
"Andre Iguodala (left calf) will be available to play Monday against the Bulls. Iguodala will be available, but the Dubs may monitor his minutes tonight with it being the second game of a back-to-back set. He's not worth owning anywhere."
"Tyreke Evans will play on Monday against the Trail Blazers. Evans was given a one-game suspension for showing up late to a recent practice, but he's done his time and both sides look ready to move on. Feel free to get him active for an uptempo matchup against Portland."
"Andrew Wiggins (quad) is on track to play against the Lakers on Monday. Head coach Tom Thibodeau said that Wiggins got through shootaround without any issues, so barring a setback during his pregame routine, he'll be back in action tonight following a two-game stint on the sidelines. With Wiggins back, Josh Okogie will return to the second unit, and he'll lose most his value with the demotion."
"Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) is questionable to play Tuesday vs. the Thunder. Mbah a Moute has missed the past two games with the knee issue, but we'll have a better idea on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround. If he's out again, Danilo Gallinari and Montrezl Harrell will split his minutes."
"James Ennis (hamstring) will remain on the sidelines for Tuesday's game against the Trail Blazers. The Rockets initially said that Ennis would miss at least two games with a Grade 2 hamstring strain, which severely undershot the mark. He could be out a few weeks with this injury, which will result in more minutes for Carmelo Anthony and Gerald Green with Melo getting the start. Ennis shouldn't be owned anywhere, and it's not clear when he'll be back."
"Mitchell Robinson will remain in the starting lineup for Monday's matchup with the Nets. David Fizdale will go with the same starting five from last Friday featuring Frank Ntilikina, Damyean Dotson, Tim Hardaway Jr., Noah Vonleh and Robinson with Enes Kanter coming off the bench. That starting group did play fairly well through the first three quarters of action against the defending champs, and Fizdale said he thought that lengthy lineup helped his team on defense. Mitchell sticking with the starting group is an excellent sign regarding his long-term outlook, so he's on the radar as a potential speculative add in deep leagues."
"Delon Wright (groin) is probable to play Monday vs. Milwaukee. Considering Wright tweaked his groin in his first game of the season on Wednesday, the Raptors will likely be taking it easy on him as he works his way back into the rotation. Even when he's 100% healthy, it's tough to see him as anything more than a low-end guy in deep leagues. For now, he can remain on the waiver wire."
"Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle) will be available to play Monday vs. the Nets. Mudiay will likely be making his regular-season debut tonight, but we'd expect his minutes to be held in check in his first game of the season. Head coach David Fizdale did say that he may start Mudiay at some point, but for now, he's safe to leave on the wire in all leagues."
"Brett Brown said that Wilson Chandler (hamstring) isn't &quot;that far off&quot; from making his regular-season debut. To be clear, Chandler will miss Monday's game against the Hawks, but he does appear to be trending in the right direction. This is great news for Chandler after Brown said a couple weeks ago that he was still &quot;a ways away,&quot; so maybe he'll be able to get back at some point during this five-game week for Philly. It's unlikely he'll have much value in fantasy hoops this season, but having him in the rotation could hurt Dario Saric."
"Sindarius Thornwell has been assigned to the Clippers' G-League affiliate. The Clippers have a ton of depth in their backcourt, so it would take a string of injuries for Thornwell to emerge as a rotation player in Los Angeles. Leave him on the wire."
"Dillon Brooks (sore right foot) is probable to play Tuesday vs. the Wizards. Brooks has been dealing with this foot issue since the season opener, but so far, he's only missed one game. In Memphis, probable tends to mean &quot;will play,&quot; and we should get official confirmation on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround. He's not a fantasy factor, though."
"Steven Adams (calf) is being listed as questionable for Tuesday's game against the Clippers. Adams was a late scratch on Sunday with the calf issue, which resulted in Nerlens Noel drawing the start, but Noel tweaked his ankle on Sunday and is now also questionable for Tuesday's game. If both these guys are out, Jerami Grant may see playing time in the 40s. We'll have a better idea on Adams' status following Tuesday morning's shootaround."
"Nerlens Noel (ankle) and Steven Adams (calf) are questionable to play Tuesday vs. the Clippers. Noel tweaked his ankle during the fourth quarter of Sunday's win over the Suns, and if both him and Adams are out on Tuesday, OKC may be forced to start Patrick Patterson and Jerami Grant in their frontcourt. Check back for another update following Tuesday morning's shootaround."
"James Harden (hamstring) is unlikely to be cleared for Friday's game vs. Brooklyn. Harden is scheduled to be re-evaluated on Thursday before the Rockets leave for a five-game road trip. Coach Mike D'Antoni said Harden is &quot;making good progress&quot; and he left the door open for him to return as soon as Saturday's game vs. Chicago on the second night of a back-to-back. Owners who have to submit weekly lineups should look at other options."
"The 76ers have exercised the fourth-year option on Ben Simmons. They also exercised the third-year options on Markelle Fultz and Dario Saric. This is just a formality and a no-brainer for the front office."
"Shaun Livingston (Right Foot Soreness) will miss Monday's game vs. Chicago. He was initially considered doubtful, so the Warriors will continue to be cautious with the veteran PG. Quinn Cook will continue to run the offense for the second unit."
"Andre Iguodala (left calf tightness) is probable for Monday vs. the Bulls. It's the second night of a back-to-back and Iggy has been banged up, so maybe the Warriors limit his minutes tonight. He's not a standard-league option and has been very underwhelming this season."
"Brandon Ingram said he will be back in the starting lineup on Monday vs. the Wolves. He's been suspended for the past four games after his altercation with the Rockets. Ingram said he didn't know the starting lineup, but made it clear that he was going to be in the first unit. This means Kyle Kuzma or Josh Hart will head back to the bench, but we'll have to wait until closer to tip-off before we know for sure."
"Aron Baynes (hamstring) is feeling much better and he's being listed as probable for Tuesday's game vs. Detroit. This is great news for Boston because they just learned that Daniel Theis (foot) is out indefinitely. If Baynes is cleared, he'll slot right back in as the backup center, but there's not much fantasy appeal. If he's not able to play, the Celtics might give Robert Williams a chance. The Celtics will list Baynes as probable."
"Daniel Theis has a slight tear of the plantar fascia in his right foot and is out indefinitely. That's the bad news. The good news is that Theis won't need surgery and he'll be re-evaluated in a couple weeks. Coach Brad Stevens said he was relieved that the diagnosis wasn't worse, but it's safe to assume the Celtics won't rush him back. Marcus Morris will continue to see a bump in minutes off the bench, and with Aron Baynes (hamstring) still hurt, maybe the Celtics give Robert Williams an opportunity."
"Darius Miller (right quad) will not play on Monday vs. the Nuggets. He was originally listed as doubtful, so no surprise here. Wes Johnson and Solomon Hill will pick up some minutes, but there isn't a clear fantasy pickup."
"Anthony Davis (elbow) will not play on Monday vs. the Nuggets. This comes from a report from Yahoo's Chris Haynes, so we don't have comments from coach Alvin Gentry or Davis yet. This is the second game in a row on the sidelines for Davis, but the fact that he's been initially labeled as questionable suggests that he's day-to-day. Nikola Mirotic and Jrue Holiday will get a lot more touches on offense, and Julius Randle will look to bounce back after getting in foul trouble vs. Rudy Gobert in his last game."
"Rodions Kurucs (ankle) will not play on Monday vs. the Knicks. He has made a strong impression, but minutes won't be easy to find now that Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is back."
"Devin Harris (hamstring) will not play on Monday vs. the Spurs. He has no timetable for a return and may not be in the rotation when he comes back."
"Kosta Koufos (right hamstring strain) is probable for Monday vs. the Heat. Koufos isn't in Sacramento's plans right now and probably won't play if he's cleared."
"Ersan Ilyasova will replace Giannis Antetokounmpo (concussion) in the starting lineup on Monday vs. Toronto. Concussions are tricky because their timetables are all over the place, but Ilyasova is a nice streaming option in the short term. In 43 starts last season, he put up 11.7 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.4 triples. The rest of the Bucks' starting lineup will benefit as well, as Giannis leads the NBA in usage rate."
"Markieff Morris is questionable for Tuesday vs. Memphis with concussion symptoms. The Wizards will evaluate him soon to determine whether or not he will be placed in the concussion protocol. The Wizards are dropping like flies and very little frontcourt depth right now. Kelly Oubre looks like the big winner if Morris sits, as he's been logging a ton of minutes in small-ball lineups. Jeff Green also benefits as well."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo has been placed in the NBA’s concussion protocol and will not play Monday against Toronto. The Raptors may have anticipated this because they have already decided to rest Kawhi Leonard. Giannis said he blacked out on Saturday when he took an elbow to the head, so it's hard to believe the Bucks let him return to that one. The entire starting lineup gets a bump with Giannis' league-leading usage rate out of the picture, and we could see more of Donte DiVincenzo, Tony Snell and Ersan Ilyasova."
"Luka Doncic is listed as questionable in the game notes for Monday night vs. the Spurs. The Mavs are calling it lower back soreness. Doncic also banged his knee on Sunday night and this is the second game of a back-to-back, so maybe they play it safe and hold him out. If Luka can't go, Dennis Smith Jr. and J.J. Barea will get a bump in usage, while Maxi Kleber could be more involved as well."
"OG Anunoby (personal) will not play on Monday vs. the Bucks. He was expected to return tonight, but Kawhi Leonard (rest) was also expected to play. Siakam played a season-high 37 minutes with OG out of the lineup on Friday, scoring 10 points with seven rebounds, three assists and one steal."
"Andrew Wiggins (quad) is a game-time call on Monday vs. the Lakers. Wiggins has missed two games in a row, but he's had the entire weekend off to get right. The Wolves will make a decision after warmups, but if he can't go, Josh Okogie could get another start and Derrick Rose will get a nice bump in value off the bench."
"Kawhi Leonard will rest on Monday vs. the Bucks. Welp. Coach Nick Nurse said on Sunday that there was &quot;no plan&quot; to sit Leonard, but Leonard's camp may be calling the shots here. This is the second game that Kawhi will miss and his fantasy owners are just hoping that this doesn't become a trend. He'll be back in the lineup on Tuesday vs. Toronto. With OG Anunoby (personal) out again, Pascal Siakam looks like a nice option after playing 37 minutes in his last game. Kyle Lowry and Danny Green also get a bump."
"76ers coach Brett Brown isn't worried about Dario Saric's struggles. &quot;I don’t think it’s anything to do with the league scouting him differently,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I think it maybe does have to do with a little bit of burnt energy. It’s the toil of a summer (Saric spent the summer with the Croatian national team). This notion, that you play 12 months and you’re really in a good flow, is a myth. It is a myth. People need rest.&quot; Saric is shooting 38.2% from the field and 27% from deep this season, but it's just a matter of time before he heats up and Philly plays five times this week."
"ESPN's Malika Andrews is reporting that Minnesota won’t consider any Jimmy Butler deal that doesn’t include Eric Gordon. We already know Houston has offered up to four first-round picks, but that offer didn't include Gordon. Butler is one of the best two-way players in the league and the Rockets are all-in on their pursuit of a championship, but it sounds like the talks have stalled once again."
"Jaylen Brown is frustrated with his slow start to the season. &quot;It’s been a little frustrating,&quot; Brown said. &quot;At the end of the day, you’ve got to make plays and hit shots. I’m trying to find a rhythm, trying to take the right shots. That’s what I’m looking for.&quot; He finally came alive for 19 points with two rebounds, one assist, one steal, one block and three 3-pointers in 25 minutes on Saturday, so hopefully that is a sign of things to come. Coach Brad Stevens hasn't lost confidence in Brown and believes he's been playing with &quot;unbelievable energy,&quot; so it will be interesting to see if he can build off that performance on Tuesday vs. Detroit."
"Wilson Chandler (hamstring) will not play on Monday vs. the Hawks. Chandler did not meet his initial target date and is progressing slower than expected.  Coach Brett Brown said that Chandler is still &quot;a ways away&quot; when asked last week, so we see no reason to stash him in most leagues."
"Knicks coach David Fizdale said Enes Kanter's frustration about his bench role did not carry over to Sunday’s practice. &quot;He sees himself as a starter too and I understand that,&quot; Fizdale said. &quot;I’m looking for combinations. He had a great practice today. He came to work. Brought good energy, was great in the film.&quot; We were worried about Kanter because he's on an expiring contract on a tanking team, and Fizdale wants to take an extended look at Noah Vonleh and Mitchell Robinson. Kanter is still an excellent per-minute fantasy contributor and could have mid-round value if he plays minutes in the mid-20s. Whether or not this move to the bench is permanent remains to be seen, but Kanter's owners shouldn't panic."
"D'Angelo Russell thinks he complements Caris LeVert well. &quot;I think we both are able to play off the ball. We’re both able to create. We just flow. We’ve got a chemistry that’s connecting well together,&quot; Russell said. &quot;I think the next step is getting other guys involved at the same time and finishing games.&quot; They combined for 48 points and 13 assists against the Warriors on Sunday, and coach Kenny Atkinson said he likes their chemistry as well. Russell is heating up after a slow start with 23.3 points, 6.0 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 4.3 triples over his last three games."
"Ira Winderman of the Sun-Sentinel said that Tyler Johnson is in jeopardy of losing his rotation spot. Goran Dragic, Rodney McGruder and Josh Richardson are all guaranteed big minutes right now, and Johnson is shooting 35.9% from the field and 3 of 18 on 3-pointers this season. Wayne Ellington will make his season debut any day now, and the Heat haven't even gotten Dion Waiters (ankle) or James Johnson (hernia) back yet. Johnson is an easy drop candidate."
"According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Cavaliers &quot;are preparing for the strong possibility&quot; that Kevin Love could miss more than a month with a left toe injury. Woj adds that the &quot;intense pain and the combination of an 0-6 start make it less logical for Love to push through the injury.&quot; Love will consult with doctors early this week, but his fantasy owners should be prepared for a lengthy absence. At this point, Love's owners should be rooting for a trade so he can salvage this season later in the campaign -- the shut-down risk is extremely high on the tanking Cavs. Larry Nance should be owned everywhere, while Cedi Osman will try to get going after a tough week."
"John Wall shot 8-of-20 from the field on Sunday, scoring 18 points with five assists, four steals and three rebounds. Wall didn't make a 3-pointer and the silver lining is that he racked up steals while committing just one turnover in 28 minutes. Prior to the game, Wizards head coach Scott Brooks emphasized defense as the key, but they lost 136-104 in L.A. tonight with the Clippers shooting 54.4% as a team. The Wizards are unintentionally tanking but it's safe to assume that Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter will continue to check the necessary boxes for fantasy owners."
"Boban Marjanovic scored 13 points with nine rebounds, two blocks, one steal and one assist in 12 minutes vs. the Wizards on Sunday. The 7'3&quot; center made only 1-of-4 free throws, but he sank 6-of-7 field goals for his first double-digit scoring performance since Oct. 19. The lopsided score tonight obscures any takeaways from Boban's activity, especially since he played a combined 10 minutes in L.A.'s previous three games. He's more of a handcuff for Montrezl Harrell and Marcin Gortat in deep leagues."
"Lou Williams scored 17 points in 16 minutes on Sunday, making 7-of-13 field goals with a pair of 3-pointers. Williams also dished out six assists with one steal and only one 3-pointer. That efficiency is key to his fantasy appeal, and his 28.6% usage is comparable to last year's 29.8%, when he unexpectedly dropped top-50 roto value. The Clippers' backcourt is deeper this season and Sweet Lou's owners should be relieved that they have a 4-2 record -- if they stay in the mix for a playoff spot, the odds of tanking decrease dramatically."
"Markieff Morris (flu) failed to score in 14 minutes on Sunday. Morris was a game-time decision and fantasy owners probably wish he'd sat it out. He missed all four of his field goal attempts, grabbed one rebound, and did nothing else statistically. The Wizards' road trip continues in Memphis on Tuesday and we expect 'Kieff to fare better vs. rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. in that game."
"Milos Teodosic chipped in three points, three assists and one steal in 11 minutes on Sunday. The veteran attempted only one shot, a made 3-pointer, and he's still far off the fantasy map. Doc Rivers has been going small with Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) out of commission, and the Clippers have won two straight, so there's at least some daylight in very deep leagues."
"Kelly Oubre took 12 shots but only scored nine points on Sunday, adding four rebounds, one assist and three turnovers in 26 minutes. Oubre made 4-of-4 free throws but just 1-of-7 shots from deep, and his inefficiency can't bode well with teammate Bradley Beal, who said prior to the game, &quot;We suck right now.&quot; The Wizards are 1-5 and the silver lining for fantasy owners is that they're unlikely to tank with a massive payroll."
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander played 28 minutes and hit 4-of-8 shots and a 3-pointer for 10 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and two steals in Sunday's 136-104 thrashing of the Wizards. SGA just keeps plugging away and tonight's line featured career highs in rebounds and assists, and he tied his career highs with the 3-pointer and two steals. He's trending up and while it might take an injury to Patrick Beverley to finally set him free, there's plenty of intrigue with SGA. He's not a must-own player, but if you have room to stash him, do it."
"Ian Mahinmi played a season-high 29 minutes on Sunday, scoring 11 points with seven rebounds and two turnovers. Mahinmi made 3-of-5 field goals and 5-of-6 free throws, but this was an aberration for multiple reasons. Starting center Dwight Howard (back) was out again, and Mahinmi hadn't played this many minutes since the 2015-16 postseason. Leave him on the wire."
"Austin Rivers had nine points (3-of-6 FGs, 2-of-3 FTs), three assists, one rebound, one steal, one block and one 3-pointer in 22 minutes on Sunday. Rivers was playing vs. his former team, with his father as the opposing coach, and he acknowledged his unique situation prior to the game. &quot;Let’s call it for what it is,&quot; he said. &quot;I played for my father in the NBA, that’s crazy.&quot; He's been a non-entity for fantasy and there's no reason to think that will change as the Wizards try to claw back from a 1-5 start to the season."
"Patrick Patterson scored 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting on Sunday, hitting two 3-pointers with four rebounds in 30 minutes of action off OKC's bench. Patterson threw down his first dunk as a member of the Thunder, and seemed rejuvenated to see some shots go in tonight. According to beat writer Brett Dawson, Patterson was &quot;clearly frustrated&quot; with his shots not falling early this season, and has been &quot;putting in some extra work.&quot; It paid off tonight but his workload was the product of Steven Adams (calf) being unavailable, so there's no reason to touch him in 12-team leagues."
"Rudy Gobert stuffed the boxscore on Sunday with 23 points, 16 rebounds, three blocks, two steals and two assists in 33 minutes. Gobert made 9-of-13 field goals and 5-of-6 free throws, and five of his rebounds came on the offensive glass. He's opened the season with six consecutive double-doubles and there's no reason to think he'll slow down, especially if Derrick Favors (knee) misses more time. Utah improved to 4-2 tonight and life is good for Gobert's fantasy owners."
"Jae Crowder made 7-of-13 shots to score 15 points on Sunday, grabbing six rebounds with one assist and one steal in 35 minutes. Derrick Favors (left knee soreness) was out tonight and the veteran Crowder stepped up in his absence. It's unclear how long Favors might be sidelined, but Crowder was already on the threshold of fantasy value with averages of 11.6 points, 1.6 triples, 5.6 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 0.6 steals. He's an intriguing DFS play if Favors misses more time, but most season-long owners can wait for higher-upside options. Crowder also appeared to tweak his right ankle late in Sunday's game, but there's no reason to suspect it will cause him to miss games."
"Georges Niang scored a season-high 13 points on 4-of-5 FGs and 3-of-3 FTs in 13 minutes off Utah's bench on Sunday. Niang sank two 3-pointers but added just one rebound without any assists or defensive stats. His 13 minutes were a season-high tonight, and that's due to the absence of  Derrick Favors (left knee), so there's very little upside here."
"Ricky Rubio cooled off on Sunday with six points on 2-of-9 shooting, eight assists, one rebound and one steal in 32 minutes. Rubio made a 3-pointer tonight but he went 1-of-2 at the line and was generally disappointing after a breakthrough game on Saturday -- 28 points, 12 assists and six boards with efficient shooting. He's had many slow starts throughout his career but tends to finish strong, so patient owners shouldn't give up on him. Just remember that he was a top-50 player after the All-Star break last year."
"Elie Okobo played a career-high 31 minutes and responded with 18 points, five rebounds, seven assists, three 3-pointers and just three turnovers in Sunday's loss to the Thunder. This was easily his best game of the young season and it came on a night when Isaiah Canaan left early with a sprained left ankle in the first quarter. The Suns already have nothing to play for and it would make sense for them to just let the kids play, and learn something in the process. We don't know the severity of Canaan's injury yet, but if you've got an extra bench spot sitting empty, or with some dead weight, taking a flier on Okobo might make sense. The Suns have said they'll trade for a veteran point guard, but that doesn't mean they will. And with Devin Booker (hamstring) also hurt, Okobo could be in line for some nice minutes in his upcoming three-game week."
"Jalen Brunson had two points and one assist in 12 minutes off the bench on Sunday, making 1-of-5 shots without any other stats to his credit. Brunson started Friday's game with Dennis Smith Jr. sidelined by a sprained ankle, but with DSJ sidelined he was relegated to a backup role. The takeaway here is that he's the clear-cut No. 2 at point guard and looks like a solid handcuff for DSJ in deep leagues."
"DeAndre Jordan had a career-high nine assists in a losing effort on Sunday, adding 12 points (4-of-5 FGs, 4-of-4 FTs), 19 rebounds and one block. DJ's previous career-high was six dimes. He has shown renewed energy with Dallas this year and is racking up early-round fantasy value as a result -- he came in averaging 16.0 points (63.0% FGs, 84.6% FTs), 13.8 boards, 2.0 dimes, 2.0 blocks and 0.6 steals. The free-throw shooting is fluky but his owners aren't complaining, as he currently has a more positive impact at the line than a bunch of FT studs including Jimmy Butler. There's no reason to think he'll drop off as the season progresses, but anything is possible if the 2-4 Mavs eventually fall out of the playoff picture."
"In his second game of the season, Harrison Barnes had seven points, three rebounds and three steals, making 3-of-13 field goals and 1-of-2 free throws in 34 minutes. A strained right hamstring cost Barnes training camp and the first four games of the regular season. He's still working back to his typical form and is just 8-of-30 from the field (26.7%) in two games, so owners may need to consider benching him until he warms up. He won't contribute many across-the-board stats but is typically a reliable contributor for points and 3-pointers with solid percentages."
"T.J. Warren hit 8-of-17 shots and two 3-pointers for 18 points, eight rebounds and a block, despite playing just 22 minutes off the bench in Sunday's loss to the Thunder. He scored just three points on Saturday, playing just 18 minutes in a blowout loss to the Grizzlies, but has been the Suns best small forward this season. He got back on track tonight, but will likely struggle on nights Trevor Ariza and Josh Jackson get hot, assuming that ever happens again. Of the three SFs in Phoenix, TJW has easily been the most consistent thus far, despite Saturday's dud."
"Josh Jackson started again for the Suns on Sunday, but played just 21 minutes and hit 4-of-10 shots for eight points, one rebound, one steal, one block and four turnovers before fouling out. He was also 0-for-3 from downtown, and just can't seem to find his way this season. He's scored eight or fewer points in four of his six games, and has scored eight points in both of his starts. It's early and there's plenty of time for him to get it turned around, but with Trevor Ariza and T.J. Warren playing the same position, Jackson just hasn't been able to get right, even with Devin Booker out with his hamstring injury."
"Luka Doncic banged his left knee on Sunday but returned to finish with 14 points, six rebounds, five assists, two 3-pointers and one steal. It wasn't all good news, as the rookie shot 5-of-13 from the field with five turnovers in the Mavs' fourth loss of the season. Doncic checked out after his knee injury in the third quarter, but he didn't miss much time and there's no reason to think he's in danger of missing Monday's road game in San Antonio."
"Dennis Smith Jr. scored a career-high 27 points on Sunday, making 12-of-19 shots with three 3-pointers, three assists, one rebound and two blocks. DSJ was returning from a right ankle injury that cost him one game, but he obviously didn't miss a beat. Efficiency has been an issue for his fantasy value but after tonight's performance he's making 48.2% of his shots, up from just 37.5% last season. Luka Doncic's playmaking could take the ball out of his hands more than owners would like, and it remains to be seen if he can sustain efficient shooting, but the early returns are encouraging. His return sent Jalen Brunson back to fantasy irrelevance."
"Ryan Anderson hit 4-of-10 shots, a 3-pointer and 6-of-6 free throws for a season-high 15 points, five rebounds and a steal in 31 minutes of Sunday's loss to the Thunder. This was his first trip to double-digit scoring this season, as well as his best game of the year. The 31 minutes were easily a season high and it's possible he's on the verge of getting hot and producing. But he's getting up there at 30 years old, and had been pretty terrible up to this point. We'll need to see it again before thinking about taking the bait."
"Jerami Grant started again and hit 4-of-9 shots, a 3-pointer and 5-of-8 free throws for a season-high 14 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal in a season-high 37 minutes on Sunday. Now that he's finally in the starting lineup, he could get hot, although he was helped tonight by the fact that Steven Adams was out with a calf injury. Grant's not a must-own player, especially with just three games next week, but he's worth keeping a close eye on as one of the only power forward options, along with Patrick Patterson, in OKC."
"Russell Westbrook played through a sore right shoulder and hit 8-of-13 shots and 7-of-10 free throws for 23 points, nine rebounds, seven assists, four steals and six turnovers in a win over the Suns. He now has 16 turnovers in just three games, and has made only one 3-pointer after not even attempting one tonight. He only played four games last season in which he didn't attempt a 3-pointer, so this was a bit of a rarity. It looks like his shoulder injury is becoming a thing of the past and he's not on a minutes limit. The Thunder play three times in Week 3, and Westbrook will hopefully be good to go in all of them."
"Paul George hit 9-of-15 shots and four 3-pointers for 23 points, four rebounds, five assists, three steals and two blocks in 30 minutes of Sunday's win over the Suns. He posted a highly efficient line in his best-shooting night of the season and committed a season-low two turnovers, arguably making this his best game of the season. He also dropped a beautiful bomb from half court for the shot of the night. The video's attached in the link in case you missed it."
"Nerlens Noel started in place of Steven Adams (calf) on Sunday and went off for 20 points, 15 rebounds, two assists, four steals and a block on 9-of-14 shooting in 26 minutes. Those were easily season highs across the board and his previous highs were nine points, seven rebounds and 15 minutes. Yes, he did this against the lowly Suns, and yes, Adams will be back soon enough, but you have to think Noel earned some more playing time, at least in the near future, with this performance. He left the game briefly after taking a shot to the head in the third quarter, but wasn't gone for long. There's no reason to jump on Noel after one good game, but this should officially start your radar on him. And if Adams is ruled out for more games, Noel should be worth using for as long as he's out. And in case you're wondering, the last time he scored at least 20 points in a game was when he had 24 points on Feb. 19 - of 2016! It's just nice to know he can still play."
"Markieff Morris (flu) will start vs. the Clippers on Sunday. Ian Mahinmi and Otto Porter will join him in the Wizards' frontcourt tonight. Morris has quietly surged past his average draft position in fantasy leagues, aided by small-ball center minutes without Dwight Howard (back), so keep trotting him out there."
"Markieff Morris (flu) is a game-time decision on Sunday. He'll warm up prior to making a final call on his status, which is mildly encouraging. If he can't suit up, the Wizards would be even thinner in the frontcourt and we'd expect Ian Mahinmi, Jeff Green and Jason Smith to log extra minutes."
"Isaiah Canaan exited Sunday's game with a sprained left ankle and he will not return. The Suns were trailing by nearly 20 points prior to halftime and Devin Booker (hamstring) is out tonight, so there was no real need for Canaan to play at less than 100 percent. We're considering him questionable for Wednesday's game vs. the visiting Spurs."
"Luc Mbah a Moute (sore left knee) won't play vs. the Wizards on Sunday. Danilo Gallinari and Montrezl Harrell stand to gain the most, but this doesn't have a huge fantasy impact since Mbah a Moute was averaging a modest 15.3 minutes per game. We're considering him day-to-day going forward."
"The Warriors improved to 6-1 this season with a win vs. Brooklyn on Sunday, aided by Kevin Durant's 34 points, eight rebounds, six assists, two 3-pointers, one steal and one block. KD made 11-of-20 field goals and 10-of-11 free throws in yet another ultra-efficient offensive performance. The eventual return of DeMarcus Cousins is the only background concern for Durant owners, as Cousins' usage could take a chunk of touches away from both KD and Steph Curry, but that's no reason to fret. He's simply a lock for elite value as long as he's healthy."
"Draymond Green dished out a season-high 13 assists on Sunday with eight points on 4-of-9 shooting, four rebounds and five steals. Green didn't get to the free-throw line and missed all three of his 3-point attempts, leaving him at just 27.3% from deep on the season. Defenses continue to abandon him at the arc, but his fantasy value shouldn't change much whether or not he knocks them down or scores more than his current 8.0 points per game. As long as the dimes and defensive stats are there, he'll be fine."
"Alfonzo McKinnie had nine points, five rebounds, one steal, one block and one 3-pointer in 17 minutes vs. the Nets on Sunday. McKinnie made 4-of-5 shots with just one turnover off the bench, and he's quietly carving out a role with Patrick McCaw's contract dispute dragging into November. This was his most well-rounded game of the season for fantasy purposes, though, and he's nowhere near standard-league value."
"Stephen Curry went off again on Sunday with a game-high 33 points on 11-of-26 shooting, seven 3-pointers, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals in 36 minutes. Curry has made 48 three-pointers this season, which is more than the combined totals for multiple <i>teams</i> at this early stage of the season -- the Cavaliers (43), Clippers (41), Nuggets (40) and Thunder (33). He's the first player in NBA history to make at least five 3-pointers in seven straight games, and has joined Anthony Davis as the top fantasy assets at this early point in the season. He's already building a case for his third MVP award. The threat of a few late-season DNPs was enough to drop his draft position in many leagues, and owners who scored him in the 6-10 range have to be thrilled with the early returns."
"Allen Crabbe hit 4-of-11 shots and four 3-pointers for a season-high 14 points, five rebounds and two assists in Sunday's loss to GSW. The rise of Caris LeVert and the strong play of Joe Harris are going to hurt Crabbe's fantasy value going forward, but he does appear to be over his ankle injury. And this was a far cry from his 0-for-7 shooting night last Wednesday. Just keep an eye on him."
"Chris LeVert hit 9-of-18 shots and a season-high four 3-pointers for 23 points, three rebounds and a season-high seven assists in 30 minutes of Sunday's loss to the Warriors. He started off the season hot, cooled off for a game last Wednesday, and has gotten back on track over his last two, scoring 23 and 21 points in each of them. He hasn't had a steal in a couple games, but the rest of his numbers are flowing, as his breakout season continues. He's a must-own fantasy player in all leagues."
"Andre Iguodala (left calf tightness) played 20 minutes off the bench on Sunday, scoring four points with five rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block. Shaun Livingston (right foot soreness) was out tonight and Iguodala led the Warriors' second unit in playing time, although that's not saying much. The former fantasy stud has been an afterthought since joining the Warriors in 2013 and there's no reason to own him outside of very deep leagues."
"D'Angelo Russell hit 9-of-14 shots and five 3-pointers for a season-high 25 points, six rebounds, six assists and a block in 30 minutes of Sunday's loss to the Warriors. He got off to a slow start this season, but has rendered Spencer Dinwiddie somewhat useless of late, and has really turned it on over his last two games. He's averaging 24.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 5.5 3-pointers over his last two games, hitting 18-of-30 shots, good for 60 percent, and has also knocked down 11-of-17 3-pointers in his last two, good for 65 percent. Hopefully you didn't panic after the slow start."
"Jarrett Allen played 29 minutes and hit 5-of-6 shots for 11 points, three rebounds, four assists, a steal and two blocks in Sunday's loss to Golden State. He's not blowing anyone's socks off with his production, but he's been quite solid from night to night. He was able to run with the Warriors tonight and helped to render both Damian Jones (2 points, 12 minutes) and Jordan Bell (2 points, 10 minutes) ineffective. Allen's still a breakout candidate, and should only get better with time. Just hang in there with him if you own him."
"Joe Harris hit 2-of-6 shots (all 3-point attempts) to finish with seven points, three rebounds, three assists and two turnovers in 30 minutes of Sunday's loss to the Warriors. Harris entered the game at No. 4 in the league in 3-point percentage (59.3%), and hit his first two of the night. However, he missed his next four triples (and shots), but has still hit 15 of his last 23 shots from beyond the arc, good for 65 percent. He's been a bit quiet in his last two games, scoring just seven points in each of them, but if you are looking for 3-pointers in your fantasy league, he's probably available."
"Jae Crowder started Sunday's game in place of Derrick Favors (left knee soreness). Georges Niang should also benefit with Favors sidelined, but Crowder is the primary beneficiary. Check back after the game to see how he fared."
"Steven Adams (calf tightness) was a last-minute scratch from the starting lineup and he will not play, with Nerlens Noel starting in his place. This report hit after the 7pm lineup-lock so there will be more than a few frustrated Adams owners in DFS and weekly leagues. Noel's per-minute upside has never been doubted and he's worth a play if Adams misses more games, though this sounds like a minor ailment that won't cost him much time. Jerami Grant and Patrick Patterson should also benefit if Adams can't suit up."
"Hamidou Diallo will not play on Sunday because he miss OKC's shootaround. It's a disciplinary move from the Thunder which should result in more minutes for Alex Abrines and Terrance Ferguson, though neither guy is appealing as a DFS plug-and-play option. Expect Diallo to resume his typical bench role vs. the Clippers on Tuesday."
"David Fizdale believes that Emmanuel Mudiay is &quot;the best passer&quot; on the Knicks and he'll eventually give him &quot;a chance to start at point guard.&quot; To be clear, Fizdale will not be bringing Mudiay into the starting lineup initially, as his conditioning isn't quite where it needs to be after sitting out the first six games of the year. However, the fact that he's toying with the idea of starting Mudiay isn't great for Trey Burke and Frank Ntilikina's outlook. The point guard situation in New York is a mess and one that should be avoided in standard leagues."
"Moe Harkless (left knee) will not suit up for Monday's game against the Pacers. Harkless was forced out of Saturday's game with the knee issue, and this is the same knee that gave him trouble during the preseason. Jake Layman and Evan Turner should split his minutes, but neither of those guys are all that attractive in fantasy hoops. Harkless belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues."
"Alec Burks (left hand contusion) will be available to play on Sunday against the Mavericks. Burks is too inconsistent to trust in fantasy hoops."
"Andrew Wiggins (right quad) is questionable to play Monday vs. the Lakers. Wiggins has missed the past two games for Minnesota, which has resulted in Josh Okogie moving into the starting lineup, and that trend should hold if Wiggins is out again tomorrow. Owners can expect to get another update following Monday morning's shootaround."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo (head contusion) is questionable for Monday's game against the Raptors. Antetokoumpo took an elbow to the head during Saturday's game, which he said caused him to briefly black out, but it's worth noting that he's not currently in the concussion protocol. We'll have a better idea on his status following Monday morning's shootaround, but if he's out, Ersan Ilyasova may move into the starting lineup and there will be more shots for the main guys in Milwaukee. Stay tuned."
"D.J. Wilson (hamstring) will not play on Monday against the Raptors. Yup."
"Courtney Lee (neck) will not play on Monday against the Nets. Lee remains without an official timetable to return and belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues."
"James Johnson (hernia) will remain on the sidelines for Monday's game against the Kings. Johnson has yet to make his regular-season debut, but he has been ramping up his activities at recent practices, which suggests he's getting close. Kelly Olynyk and Justise Winslow will continue to split the power forward minutes while Johnson is out."
"Devin Harris (hamstring) will remain on the sidelines for Sunday's game against the Jazz. Head coach Rick Carlisle did say that there's a chance Harris could play on Wednesday against the Lakers, but they aren't in any rush to get him back and don't want to push him. He'll be a negligible part of the rotation this season and belongs on the waiver wire in all leagues."
"Julius Randle (left foot) is probable to play Monday against the Nuggets. Randle is dealing with plantar fasciitis in his left foot, which is one of the worst words you can read in basketball, but thus far that issue hasn't forced him to spend any time on the sidelines. Anthony Davis (elbow) is questionable for Monday's game, and if he's out, Randle will likely be getting another start."
"Darius Miller (right quad) is doubtful to play Monday vs. the Nuggets. Miller sat out Saturday's game against the Jazz, and it's looking like Monday will be his second straight game on the sidelines. Wes Johnson and Solomon Hill will split his minutes, but that doesn't mean much in fantasy hoops."
"Elfrid Payton (right ankle) has been ruled out for Monday's matchup with the Nuggets. Payton exited Saturday's game after twisting his ankle, and while he was initially able to play through it, it seems that the ankle swelled up on him overnight. With Payton unavailable on Monday, we could see Tim Frazier enter the starting lineup and there will be more minutes for guys like Ian Clark and Frank Jackson. Jrue Holiday will also spend a bit more time running the offense."
"Russell Westbrook (right shoulder) will play on Sunday against the Suns. Westbrook sat out Saturday's practice with the shoulder issue, but there's been no word on a minutes limit, so owners shouldn't hesitate to get him active for a favorable matchup vs. Phoenix. Joining Westbrook in the starting five will be Paul George, Terrance Ferguson, Jerami Grant and Steven Adams."
"Jalen Brunson will return to the bench for Sunday's game against the Jazz. Dennis Smith Jr. (ankle) will be back in action tonight following a one-game stint on the sidelines, so Brunson's minutes will likely trend back towards the teens. He's not a viable target in most settings while the point guards in Dallas are healthy."
"Dennis Smith Jr. (right ankle) is good to go for Sunday's game against the Jazz. DSJ sat out Friday's game, but he'll be back out there tonight with his normal minutes, which will shift Jalen Brunson back to the second unit. Feel free to get him active."
"Andre Iguodala (calf) will play on Sunday in Brooklyn. Iguodala should see his normal minutes with the second unit today, but he's not bringing enough to the box score to warrant any attention in fantasy hoops."
"Per Nuggets' head coach Mike Malone, Jarred Vanderbilt (foot) is still &quot;a ways away&quot; from being able to practice. The Nuggets will bring him along slowly, but even when he's cleared to play, he'll be a non-factor in the rotation."
"Justin Anderson (leg) will remain on the sidelines for Monday's game against the 76ers. He's yet to make his season debut and shouldn't be owned anywhere."
"Shaun Livingston (sore right foot) will not suit up for Sunday's game against the Nets, and will likely miss Monday's game in Chicago as well. Livingston tweaked his right foot just prior to the season opener, and it appears it's developed into a nagging issue. With the 33-year-old guard set to miss the next two games, we'll see some more Quinn Cook with the second unit, but that doesn't mean much with Stephen Curry healthy."
"There will be no firm timetable on Kevin Love (foot) before Monday or Tuesday and there's a chance he could sit a &quot;longer-term&quot; to rest his sore foot, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times. The Cavs just fired Tyronn Lue and are 0-6. Love is looking at a potential extended absence as the Cavs weather the storm. With Love out, everyone on the Cavs will see more looks and Larry Nance, Sam Dekker, and Channing Frye will see more time at power forward."
"Thabo Sefolosha (left ankle) is available for the Jazz on Sunday after serving his 5-game suspension for violating NBA's Anti-Drug Program. Sefolosha has yet to play this season and is unlikely to be a factor in the rotation for the Jazz. However, he could see an uptick in minutes with Derrick Favors set to miss this one."
"Russell Westbrook (right shoulder soreness) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Suns. Westbrook didn't practice on Saturday and with no shootaround on Sunday, he's shaping up to be a game-time decision. Stay tuned for updates."
"Derrick Favors (left knee soreness) will not play on Sunday against the Mavs. Favors hasn't looked healthy and has battled soreness in his knee for at least a week now. Jae Crowder stands to benefit a good bit from his absence. Georges Niang is also likely to see an uptick in minutes."
"J.J. Barea (left hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Jazz. Barea played through his hamstring issue on Friday and looks set to do so again on Sunday. He's decent source of assists in the short-term."
"Dennis Smith Jr. (right ankle sprain) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Jazz. DSJ tweaked his ankle in Wednesday's game and did not play on Friday, with Jalen Brunson starting in his absence. He warmed up prior to Friday's game, but just didn't feel right. We'll know his status for sure a little bit later on. Stay tuned."
"Shaun Livingston (sore right foot) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Nets. Livingston played just nine minutes in the Warriors' previous game and they'll likely proceed with caution with the veteran. Quinn Cook would see an increase in action with Livingston out."
"Emmanuel Mudiay (ankle) practiced Sunday and is probable to play on Monday. Mudiay is set to make his season debut. As it stands, he's not worth owning in any format."
"Zhou Qi (sprained left knee) returned to practice on Sunday and might be available to play Tuesday. Qi has not played this season and is unlikely to be a factor in the Rockets' rotation with them at full strength."
"Marquese Chriss (left ankle) returned to practice on Sunday and might play on Tuesday. Chriss has a chance to earn minutes as the backup center, but isn't guaranteed to do so with Isaiah Hartenstein playing well. Chriss isn't worth a roster spot right now."
"Dwight Howard (back) is listed as out for Sunday's game against the Clippers. Howard has yet to make his Wizards debut and seems unlikely to make it on Sunday. Ian Mahinmi will continue to start in his absence."
"Andre Iguodala (left calf strain) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Nets. Iguodala has dealt with this minor calf ailment for about a week now, but hasn't missed any game action. The Warriors will continue to monitor him closely. Jonas Jerebko and Alfonzo McKinnie would see more minutes in the event that Iguodala were to sit this one out."
"Markieff Morris (flu-like symptoms) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Clippers. Morris missed Saturday's practice, but did play 37 minutes on Friday. Hopefully they're just being cautious and he can suit up tonight. Jeff Green and Kelly Oubre would benefit if he were to sit."
"Devin Booker (hamstring) will miss his second straight game on Sunday. Booker was able to get up some shots during shootaround, but he didn't have much lift on his jumper, which isn't a great sign regarding his status for Wednesday's game against the Spurs. Josh Jackson and Elie Okobo will see an uptick in minutes in Booker's absence, and Deandre Ayton will be very busy on offense."
"Dzanan Musa was recalled from the G-League. Musa as assigned to the G-League earlier on Sunday and it was probably just a procedural move. He's not on the fantasy radar."
"Coach Nick Nurse said on Sunday that there's currently &quot;no plan&quot; to sit Kawhi Leonard in the team's upcoming back-to-back on Monday and Tuesday. &quot;We're gonna go play 'em,&quot; Nurse said. &quot;He's feeling good and feeling fine, and we'll go from there.&quot; Leonard sat out the second-half of the Raps' first back-to-back, but it's great to hear that he's healthy enough to not have them planning to sit him. He's been a stud so far and will continue to be one as long as he's playing."
"Delon Wright (groin) has only played five minutes this season, but is expected to return for Monday's game in Milwaukee. Wright came back and felt tightness in his injured groin, which limited him to five minutes in his season debut. He was likely to be limited in that game anyway, so they took no chances. Fred VanVleet is questionable, so the Raptors could use Wright off the bench. He's more important to his team than he is to fantasy owners and is best left as a free agent in most leagues."
"OG Anunoby (personal) did not play on Friday, but is expected to return for the Raptors' next game on Monday. Anunoby didn't practice Sunday and still isn't with the team, but is expected to meet them in Milwaukee ahead of their matchup with the undefeated Bucks. He'll be tasked with trying to slow Giannis Antetokounmpo, which is helpful to the Raps but not helpful to fantasy owners. He's best left on the wire in most leagues."
"Fred VanVleet (turf toe) has missed the Raptors last two games, but practiced in a limited fashion on Sunday and is questionable for Monday's game. VanVleet is a key cog in the Raptors bench unit, so they're playing it safe with him as he still has some pain. He was originally probable to play on Friday, but ended up being held out. Delon Wright is expected to return and should see an uptick in minutes if FVV were to miss his third straight game."
"After Saturday's game against Portland, Dwyane Wade said the team's goal was to shoot 100 shots. &quot;We didn’t even reach our goal tonight,&quot; Wade said. &quot;We wanted to shoot 100 shots. We didn’t get there. We got close. It’s fast-paced. It’s get looks up, contested threes, open threes, rhythm threes. That’s just the game it is.&quot; They took 96 shots, just shy of their stated goal. The Heat are embracing the league's fast-paced revolution, which is great for the fantasy outlook of their many relevant players. More shots means more opportunities to produce, as shown by the Heat having eight guys averaging points in double-figures."
"Kevin Knox (sprained left ankle) is expected to return somewhere between the 2nd and 10th of November, his dad told the Marc Berman of the New York Post. The elder Knox said that his son did not suffer a high-ankle sprain and that his pain is now down to a 3 after it being a 9 immediately following the injury (on a scale of 1-10). Knox was getting some shots up at Knicks practice on Friday and is slowly getting closer to making his return. Damyean Dotson, Mario Hezonja, Allonzo Trier, Noah Vonleh, and Mitchell Robinson are among the guys benefiting from Knox's absence. We have yet to hear anything official from the Knicks."
"Cristiano Felicio played over Robin Lopez again in Saturday's win against the Hawks. Felicio even played the final 15 minutes over Wendell Carter Jr. because he was playing well. Lopez appears to be destined for a trade, making Felicio a potential add in deep-leagues and a cheap option in DFS moving forward."
"Larry Drew will be promoted to be the interim head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers  with Tyronn Lue being let go, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Drew has been a head coach with the Hawks and Bucks and has been an assistant in Cleveland since 2014. There's a good chance he'll man the ship for the rest of the season."
"The Cleveland Cavaliers are planning to fire head coach Tyronn Lue, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic. The Cavs are off to a dreadful start, having lost all six of their games this season. Charania is reporting that the Cavs' roster has been informed of the decision."
"Aron Baynes (hamstring) has missed the Celtics last three games, but has a chance to practice Monday and play Tuesday. Coach Brad Stevens said the team wanted to be cautious with Baynes, which is why he sat out on Saturday against the Pistons. His eventual return will take minutes from Daniel Theis, Guerschon Yabusele, and Marcus Morris."
"Wayne Ellington (ankle) was available for the first time on Saturday, but didn't enter the game. &quot;Just wasn’t enough minutes tonight,&quot; Spoelstra said. &quot;But Wayne has been through this before. Two years ago, he was out for more than six weeks and he found his way back in. It’s still early on. But I love the fact that he’s back in uniform.&quot; With Rodney McGruder playing well, Ellington might not see much time. The Heat are still without James Johnson and Dion Waiters, meaning minutes will be even tougher to come back for a few guys, including Ellington. He's safe to leave on the waiver wire."
"Hassan Whiteside only scored six points in Saturday's win against the Blazers, but still made a huge impact in the final minutes. &quot;[Whiteside] mentioned that he was just trying to do whatever he could to put his fingerprints on this win,&quot; coach Erik Spoelstra said. &quot;And down the stretch, that was a couple big contests to force some misses and a couple big rebounds. And even the offensive rebound. That’s winning basketball.&quot; Whiteside blocked six shots and secured 16 rebounds. The Heat have been much better with him on the floor this year, which is great for his fantasy value."
"Dzanan Musa has been assigned to the Long Island Nets of the NBA's G-League. Musa hasn't played much this season, even with the Nets numerous injuries. He was picked 29th in the 2018 Draft and the Nets like his long-term outlook."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo (head) said he briefly blacked out after taking an inadvertent elbow to the head during Saturday's game. He said all concussion tests were negative, which allowed him to return to the game in the fourth quarter. Even though tests were negative at the time, that doesn't mean symptoms won't crop up today or tomorrow. Hopefully that isn't the case, but concussions can be tricky. The Bucks next play on Monday 10/29."
"Tyreke Evans (personal) is back with the team after serving his one-game suspension. &quot;I was late for practice,&quot; said Evans. &quot;This is the most professional and team-oriented organization I have been with in my career. They deserve my best every day and I am disappointed in myself for causing a distraction that prevents me from being able to help my team tomorrow. I will do better.&quot; Evans realizes he made a mistake and is ready to return to action."
"Pau Gasol was productive in just 17 minutes on Saturday, scoring 11 points (4-of-5 FGs, 3-of-4 FTs) with 10 rebounds against the Lakers. Gasol has only played more than 20 minutes once this season and looks unlikely to reach that number most nights. He's only blocked one shot thus far and that doesn't help his fantasy value. Pau is a low-end center in deeper leagues."
"Dante Cunningham scored four points with five rebounds, one steal and no turnovers in 16 minutes during a start against the Lakers on Saturday. He was out there to guard LeBron James and that was pretty much it. Cunningham has routinely been one of the lowest usage rate players among rotation options, and he doesn't add defensive stats. Leave him on the wire."
"Davis Bertans did not score in his first start of the season against the Lakers on Saturday. He came off the bench in his four games this year, but he didn't start the second half. Bertans won't have much value while Rudy Gay is healthy."
"Jakob Poeltl was a DNP-CD against the Lakers on Saturday. As talented as he is and as helpful as he was in Toronto, coach Gregg Popovich just doesn't trust Poeltl yet."
"Rudy Gay was moved to the bench on Saturday, but still scored 16 points (6-of-15 FGs) with 10 rebounds, five assists, one steal, and two blocks in 33 minutes against the Lakers. Gay didn't start the first half, but did start the second half. Coach Gregg Popovich has juggled his lineups based on matchups so far this year and Gay was impacted by that tonight. Still, he was very productive and still managed 33 minutes. He has two consecutive double-doubles and should be a reasonably steady contributor moving forward."
"Marc Gasol (neck) scored 19 points with eight rebounds, three assists, three steals and three 3-pointers in 31 minutes against the Suns during a 117-96 win on Saturday. That scary neck issue was an afterthought as the Grizzlies handled their business on offense to put this game away early. Thanks to a 42-point fourth, they had a 25-point lead at half to tie largest halftime lead in a home game since a 25-point edge in 2005. As for Gasol, his fantasy owners may want to sell high at their best opportunity given his injury history and at age 33."
"DeMar DeRozan was exceptional on Saturday, scoring 30 points (14-of-23 FGs, 2-of-2 FTs) with 12 rebounds, eight assists, two steals, and one block in 39 minutes against the Lakers. DeRozan was a big reason why the Spurs came back to win against the Lakers. He's not attempting many triples, but he's still scoring at a steady rate. Add on his assists and he's been an exceptional fantasy option so far. The Spurs need him to handle and score and he's been doing both so far. He's scored 28+ in four of his first five games with the Spurs. He's going to have a big year."
"Jaren Jackson Jr. scored six points with two rebounds, one assist, one block, one steal and five fouls in just 15 minutes against the Suns on Saturday. Foul trouble got him this time and that issue has re-surfaced with 5.0 fouls over his last four. That aside, JJJ is cleaning up with blocks and has a steal in each game -- three in the opener. With JaMychal Green still out, Jackson Jr. will have plenty of leash to improve on his mistakes. Maybe this could be a mini-opportunity to buy low."
"Dillon Brooks scored eight points with six rebounds, two assists, two steals and one 3-pointer in 27 minutes against the Suns on Saturday. He had a good amount of volume in his rookie season, but the Grizzlies have a decent NBA roster this time around. Brooks won't offer enough upside in most leagues."
"MarShon Brooks scored 18 points with three rebounds, one assist and two 3-pointers in 19 minutes against the Suns on Saturday. Garbage time special here with 10 in the fourth to make his night. He may stay in the rotation because of the injury to Chandler Parsons (knee), but he's only worth a flier in deep leagues."
"Lonzo Ball only played 27 minutes on Saturday, scoring just six points (2-of-8 FGs, 0-of-2 FTs) with two rebounds, three assists, and two 3-pointers against the Spurs. Ball remained in the starting lineup with Rajon Rondo back from suspension, but he saw less court time. In the three games without Rondo, Ball averaged 6.7 assists. In the three games with Rondo, Ball has averaged just 2.7 assists. The Lakers have a lot to figure out with their rotation and it looks like Lonzo will be inconsistent for the near future. Better days are ahead."
"Kyle Anderson scored two points with five rebounds, one assist and one turnover in 21 minutes against the Suns on Saturday. Yeah, so Slow-Mo has been more like No-Go. Nobody expected Anderson to light up the scoring column, but 3.8 points per game over his first five is not gonna cut it. He's not having much offense go through him, the defensive stats haven't been there and he's only playing 21.9 minutes per game. He's looking like a drop in shallower formats or for a hotter free agent."
"Rajon Rondo returned from suspension on Saturday against the Spurs, scoring 12 points (4-of-8 FGs) with four rebounds, five assists, and two 3-pointers in 29 minutes. Rondo came off the bench but still saw 29 minutes in Saturday's loss. He's clearly a big part of the Lakers plans, at least for now. He's been seeing staggered minutes with LeBron, but gets time closing out games. Rondo's also hit at least one triple in his three games this year, which would be a great development for his fantasy value. The Lakers have a lot to sort out with Brandon Ingram returning next game and Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart emerging. Still, Rondo remains a fantasy option due to his assists."
"Deandre Ayton made 12-of-13 from the field for 24 points with eight rebounds, five assists, one steal and no turnovers in a 117-96 loss to the Grizzlies on Saturday. Impressive. Sure, a lot of his stats came when the game was decided, but the Suns got much more than they bargained for with his touch on offense and his excellent passing out of the post. Ayton is more than just a rim-running big and it's hard to believe he's played just five NBA games, averaging 17.8 points, 10.2 boards, 0.8 blocks and 0.6 steals on 69.6 FG% and 84.6 FT%. He looks like the real deal."
"Nikola Vucevic scored 16 points vs. the Bucks on Saturday, adding nine rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 21 minutes. Don't read into the low minutes because this game was over in a hurry. Vucevic was the 10th ranked fantasy player in 9-category leagues entering tonight’s game and Mo Bamba doesn’t appear to be a threat to his workload right now. In fact, coach Steve Clifford said Bamba is not anywhere near ready to start and gushed about Vucevic’s play. It also helps that Orlando lacks a starting-level PG, as Vucevic is on pace for a career-high in assists (4.8). He’s crushing his ADP and fantasy owners should enjoy the ride."
"Mo Bamba played 23 minutes in Saturday's lopsided loss vs. the Bucks, finishing with seven points, six rebounds and two triples. The Magic can’t really use Bamba next to Nikola Vucevic for long stretches right now, as that combo has a brutal -62.5 net rating through the first five games. Sure it's a small sample size, but it’s just something the rookie isn’t ready for. He’s more of a stash for blocks-needy owners with Vucevic dominating in the first unit."
"Elie Okobo scored a career-high 12 points with two assists and two 3-pointers in 18 minutes against the Grizzlies on Saturday. It was good showing in his first shot at the rotation with Devin Booker (hamstring) out. Okobo has good fundamentals on offense and he's been a good cutter since Vegas, so that could translate for when the Suns want to put him next to Booker eventually. Just keep an eye on him in super deep leagues."
"Donte DiVincenzo scored a career-high 15 points in a blowout win vs. the Magic on Saturday, adding three boards and one triple in 18 minutes. DiVincenzo was playing 20.0 minutes per game prior to Saturday, taking some of the minutes that Tony Snell had last season. He hasn’t been very productive yet with 6.2 points, 3.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 0.4 blocks, 0.4 steals and 1.0 triples prior to Saturday, but it’s starting to look like he will benefit the most if any of the starting five picks up an injury."
"Josh Jackson made 3-of-10 from the field and 2-of-6 from the line for eight points in a start at shooting guard on Saturday, adding three rebounds, three assists, three steals and seven turnovers in 24 minutes. Yeah, 0.4 points per possession is not good. Since summer league, Jackson continues to take shots he shouldn't and try to make plays that aren't there. He's lost a lot of his momentum he built from January to April, but the Suns will likely let him have his growing pains. Devin Booker (hamstring) should be back soon, so that could get Jackson back into his comfort zone."
"LeBron James scored 35 points (13-of-21 FGs, 7-of-8 FTs) with 11 rebounds, four assists, two steals, and two 3-pointers in 34 minutes against the Spurs on Saturday. After three straight double-digit assists games, LeBron posted a season-low four assists. It's no coincidence that Rajon Rondo returned from a 3-game suspension tonight. LeBron's not handling the ball as much with Rondo in the lineup and the assist totals show that. Still, LeBron is a fantasy monster no matter how much we nitpick."
"Malcolm Brogdon scored a season-high 16 points in Saturday's 113-91 win over the Magic, adding four rebounds, two assists, two triples and two turnovers in 30 minutes. Brogdon is flirting with top-100 value and was averaging 11.6 points, 4.4 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 1.6 triples in 31.6 minutes entering tonight’s game. &quot;Complete credit to [coach Mike Budenholzer], not only do we have a great system that plays to our strengths...but he takes care of our bodies,&quot; Brogdon said. &quot;We don't feel run down.&quot; The Bucks are off to their best start in franchise history (6-0) and their entire starting lineup is on pace to finish inside the top-100 in Bud’s fantasy-friendly offense."
"Isaiah Canaan scored 11 points with four rebounds, four assists and two turnovers in 30 minutes against the Grizzlies on Saturday. He didn't really get a Devin Booker (hamstring) bump because the Suns went young. Booker isn't going to be out long, but Canaan could have some value for PG-needy owners."
"Khris Middleton scored 18 points vs. the Magic on Saturday, hitting 4-of-9 shots and 8-of-8 free throws with seven rebounds, four assists, one steal and two triples in 27 minutes. Middleton is crushing it to begin the season, posting top-15 value in 9-category leagues. His elite true shooting percentage (70.8%) ranks in the top five among wings, and he’s hitting 57.9% of his pull-up triples which ranks third in the NBA. Coach Mike Budenholzer encouraged him over the summer to cut out his mid-range shot and focus on 3-pointers, and we’re already seeing the dividends with 4.4 3-pointers per game compared to 1.8 last season."
"T.J. Warren scored three points with three rebounds, one assist, one block and one foul in 18 minutes against the Grizzlies on Saturday. The Suns went heavy with their rookies and it hurt Warren's playing time in this ugly loss. This wasn't a concern heading into the night, so Warren's fantasy owners shouldn't panic yet. Devin Booker (hamstring) shouldn't be out long."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from a head injury on Saturday vs. the Magic, finishing with 21 points, seven rebounds, one assist, one block and four turnovers in 19 minutes. He went back to the locker room a couple of times after an early collision with Aaron Gordon, but fantasy owners can breathe easy because he's going to be just fine. Giannis is leading the NBA in usage rate (34.6%), and once his efficiency picks back up he should right back in the top-5 of 9-category rankings."
"Mikal Bridges scored seven points with six rebounds, two assists and one 3-pointer in 24 minutes against the Grizzlies on Saturday. The Suns went back to their preseason rotation with Bridges as a backup wing, and that could continue while Devin Booker (hamstring) is out. Still, Bridges is nowhere near the fantasy map in 12-team leagues and he still hasn't shown any flashes dating back to Vegas."
"Kelly Olynyk scored a season-high 19 points vs. the Blazers on Saturday, adding six rebounds, five assists, one steal, one block and three triples in 29 minutes. After playing 16 or less minutes in the opening three games, Olynyk has responded with back-to-back strong performances. He was 6-of-9 from the field and 4-of-5 from the line tonight, and he's averaging 15.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.0 triples over his last two games. Now that he's hot again, Olynyk is worth a look in standard leagues if you're targeting points, triples, out-of-position assists and shooting percentages."
"Nicolas Batum struggled on Saturday, scoring two points (1-of-5 FGs) but added 10 rebounds, four assists, and two blocks in 31 minutes against the 76ers. Batum has not shot the ball well of late and has ceded most play-making duties to Kemba Walker. Batum is still a nice source of stats across the board, but might not produce the 5+ assists per game we've become accustom to with Walker running the show. The Hornets have a bunch of young wings that are coming for his time, but Batum will continue to hold them off because of his versatility. Don't panic."
"Ryan Anderson (hip) scored seven points with two rebounds, three assists, one steal and one 3-pointer in 22 minutes against the Grizzlies on Saturday. Even with the Suns losing depth, they're just not going to play Anderson big minutes."
"Ryan Arcidiacono scored a career-high 13 points with two rebounds, seven assists, two steals, one block and three 3-pointers in 31 minutes during a 97-85 win over the Hawks on Saturday. It was his best game as he dominated Trae Young to help the Bulls get the win.  Arcidiacono isn't exactly a top prospect despite his time at Villanova, so he would only be worth a speculative look in deep leagues. Even if he does beat out Cam Payne, Kris Dunn should be back next month."
"Goran Dragic scored a season-high 28 points on 10-of-19 shooting in Saturday's 120-111 win over the Blazers. The Heat improved to 3-2 because of Dragic's heroics, and he added five assists, three boards and four triples in 35 minutes. He has now attempted at least 14 shots in four out of five games, but could lose some touches with the Heat finally getting some bodies back."
"Bam Adebayo scored seven points with six rebounds in 14 minutes vs. the Blazers on Saturday. Hassan Whiteside is healthy and motivated, and Kelly Olynyk is starting to heat up after his slow start. With James Johnson nearing a return, we see no reason to stash Bam right now."
"Devonte' Graham saw the most playing time in his young career on Saturday, scoring seven points with two rebounds, two assists, and one 3-pointer in 13 minutes against the Sixers. Graham was the backup point guard with Tony Parker resting and was productive in his time on the court. With Parker healthy, Graham won't see much time. However, Parker isn't getting any younger and the Hornets might eventually want to see what they have in Graham. He's a name to file away for a late-season add."
"Wendell Carter Jr. scored 10 points with 10 rebounds, one assist, one steal, two blocks and one foul in 22 minutes against the Hawks on Saturday. He's from Atlanta and maybe that helped him get going after a rough start to his career.  The best news is Carter Jr. only had one foul and one turnover, so keeping those in check will go a long way. Rookies need time to get their feet wet and he has the starting job locked up, but WJC has enough upside to allow a lot leash in standard leagues."
"Tyler Johnson scored seven points vs. the Blazers on Saturday, adding three rebounds, two assists, one steal and one triple in 19 minutes. Wayne Ellington was cleared to return from his ankle injury, but picked up a DNP-CD. Johnson hasn't played well this season and is on thin ice, so there's a chance he loses some minutes in the near future. He belongs on the waiver wire in standard leagues."
"Zach LaVine grabbed a career-high 11 boards against the Hawks on Saturday, adding 27 points, three assists, one steal, one 3-pointer and nine turnovers in 35 minutes. Make it six straight with 20-plus points for the longest stretch of his career. He was a little sloppy as evident by the turnovers, and those elevated his usage rate to 33.5 on the year. His shot selection is getting a little worse after being almost flawless to start the year, but he's still at an outstanding 65.2 TS%. His scoring breakout continues and his owners should expect him to be around 25 per game."
"Kemba Walker continued his high-usage start to the season, scoring 37 points on 11-of-31 shooting with six rebounds, six assists, one steal, two blocks, and three 3-pointers in 35 minutes against the Sixers on Saturday. Walker was one of two Hornets to take double-digit shots, with Jeremy Lamb being the other at just 12 attempts. Kemba is running the show and has the ball in his hands most of the time. Even though he couldn't get his shot to fall, he still managed to get to the line 14 times (12-of-14). Even when he's off, he's still producing. Kemba's a top-20 player going forward."
"Justise Winslow (sore right hamstring) made his season debut vs. the Blazers on Saturday, scoring 10 points (3-of-8 FGs, 3-of-3 FTs) with five rebounds, one assist, three steals, one block and one triple in 19 minutes. There's no way coach Erik Spoelstra is taking Rodney McGruder out of the starting lineup, so Winslow will likely continue anchoring the second unit. He's just a lukewarm pickup in deeper leagues and has some efficiency concerns."
"Derrick Jones Jr. (foot) picked up a DNP-CD on Saturday vs. Portland. Airplane Mode was cleared to play tonight and is healthy again, but may be out of the rotation for the time being with Justise Winslow back in the lineup. Jones Jr. belongs on the wire outside of dynasty formats."
"Chandler Hutchison scored four points with four rebounds and two steals in 18 minutes during his second start on Saturday. He did get some minutes at small forward next to Jabari Parker, but Hutchison isn't quite ready to be a contributor as a scorer and he's not going to add defensive stats. He'll likely need garbage time to put up value in deep of DFS leagues."
"Wayne Ellington (ankle) picked up a DNP-CD on Saturday vs. Portland. His season debut will have to wait despite the Heat calling him &quot;available.&quot; With the way Rodney McGruder has looked alongside Josh Richardson, Ellington's path to fantasy value isn't great."
"Shaq Harrison played four minutes with one assist in his Bulls debut on Saturday. His minutes came as a wing, but Harrison did handle the ball a bunch. He had a good run in his brief time with a +6, but there's no need to add him almost anywhere."
"Jusuf Nurkic scored a season-low five points vs. the Heat on Saturday, adding seven rebounds, one steal and one block in 27 minutes. This was his first dud of the season and he ran into an in-form Hassan Whiteside, so his owners should cut him some slack. Zach Collins has made a case for a larger role, but Nurk Alert is still on pace to comfortably outperform his ADP. His owners should be in a good spot next week with five games on the schedule."
"Cameron Payne scored two points with two rebounds, five assists, one stela and one turnover in 18 minutes against the Hawks on Saturday. Ryan Arcidiacono took over late in this game and coach Fred Hoiberg didn't want to go back to Payne. He had played well in his previous two, so his owners should stick with him."
"Zach Collins scored 13 points (2-of-4 FGs, 8-of-8 FTs) vs. the Heat on Saturday, adding four rebounds, two blocks and one triple in 24 minutes. He played just six minutes in the first half with two quick fouls, but came alive in the second half. Collins was averaging 10.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 2.3 blocks and 1.0 triples entering Saturday's game and has been a mid-round value despite playing around 20 minutes. With Portland playing five games next week, Collins is a great pickup in standard leagues to see if he can keep this going."
"Robert Covington was everywhere on Saturday, scoring 18 points (6-of-11 FGs, 4-of-7 3PTs, 2-of-5 FTs) with 10 rebounds, two steals, four blocks, and four 3-pointers in 36 minutes against the Hornets. Lord Covington stuffed the stat sheet and had a superb all-around game in this one. He had a late block on Kemba Walker that helped the Sixers seal the win. He struggled from the free throw line, but he's usually a good free throw shooter. He only posted four double-doubles last year with Ben Simmons in the fold. Nights like this are why RoCo is a valuable fantasy asset."
"Jake Layman played 12 minutes vs. the Heat on Saturday, scoring seven points with one assist and one triple. He’s been hanging around 12 minutes per game this season despite being a &quot;starter.&quot; Even with Moe Harkless’ knee flaring up again, Layman simply isn’t relevant in most fantasy leagues. Evan Turner is the better deep-league pickup."
"Trae Young made 3-fo-12 from the field for 13 points with three rebounds, four assists, two steals and five turnovers in a 97-85 loss to the Bulls on Saturday. Ice Trae melted in this one, missing all six from deep and getting torched by Ryan Arcidiacono. Young continues to dominate the rock as one of the leaders in time of possession, his usage rate is better than expected and the Hawks are flying with an NBA-high 108.6 pace."
"Evan Turner scored eight points (3-of-10 FGs) with four rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks in 25 minutes vs. the Heat on Saturday. He might have a few more minutes coming his way, as Moe Harkless’ left knee flared up on him again and he wasn’t able to return. Turner has been quiet up to this point with 9.8 points, 5.3 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.0 steals with no triples entering Saturday’s game, and it’s unlikely that Harkless’ latest setback will catapult Turner into standard-league relevance."
"Damian Lillard scored a season-high 42 points in Saturday's 120-111 loss to Miami, hitting 15-of-28 shots and 7-of-7 free throws with seven rebounds, six assists, one steal, one block and three turnovers. Apparently the heckling fan from Thursday is still in the back of Lillard's head. That's his 18th career game with 40+ points which moves him past Clyde Drexler for most in Trail Blazers history. He's got the Western Conference Player of the Week Award locked up as he's coming off a 41-point game vs. Orlando, and we're still feeling confident about calling him a top-10 fantasy asset the rest of the way."
"DeAndre Bembry scored eight points with one rebound, two assists, one block, three steals and two 3-pointers in 27 minutes against the Bulls on Saturday. Last season was about as bad as it could get, but this year he's making up ground. Coach Lloyd Pierce has praised Bembry's ability to break down defenses, and it's reflected in the rotation with Bembry getting at least 27 minutes in three of the last four. He's not quite standard-league material yet, but that could change if the Hawks unload some guys."
"Joel Embiid (ankle) didn't appear to be slowed by his ankle injury, scoring 27 points (10-of-22 FGs, 1-of-5 3PTs, 6-of-6 FTs) with 14 boards, two assists, two blocks, and one 3-pointer in 37 minutes against the Hornets on Saturday. It wasn't clear before the game whether or not Embiid would be limited by the ankle tweak he suffered in Friday's practice, but he removed all doubt once the game began. Embiid now has six consecutive double-doubles to start the season and has played 33+ minutes in each game. He'll have an injury scare every now and then, but he's a fantasy monster when he's available."
"Ben Simmons struggled from the field, making only 5-of-20 shots for 14 points with 12 rebounds, three assists, one steal, and four turnovers in 32 minutes against the Hornets on Saturday. Simmons posted a shockingly-low assist total tonight, but that's probably because he took a season-high 20 shots. Despite only three assists, he's still averaging over seven per game thus far. It was nice to see him in attack mode from the jump, but the efficiency obviously needs to be better. Simmons might be asked to be in attack mode more often with Markelle Fultz able to run the offense, too. Keep rolling Simmons out there with confidence."
"Dewayne Dedmon scored 13 points with 13 rebounds, five blocks and one 3-pointer in 27 minutes against the Bulls on Saturday. He kept the Hawks in this game with a team-high +18. Dedmon looked like himself in this game after his avulsion fracture kept him out of camp and the first week of the season. Bigs can be tough to come by and the Hawks don't have Alex Poythress (knee) now, so Dedmon is worth a long look for anyone needing a big man."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo (head) wasn't with the team on the bench to start the second half but came back to the bench and entered the game in the fourth quarter. Giannis has been in and out for most of the game due to an early collision with Aaron Gordon. Hopefully we find out more information once the game concludes."
"Rodney Hood scored a season-high 17 points in Saturday's loss to the Pacers, hitting 8-of-15 shots with five rebounds, three assists, two steals and one triple. He had a 23.2 usage rate with Kevin Love (foot) sitting out another game and led the Cavaliers in points and shot attempts and was second to Cedi Osman in minutes. Hood was hitting just 38.6% of his shots before Saturday, but has scored in double digits in each game so far. Hood might be relevant for the foreseeable future because of the lack of talent in Cleveland."
"Rudy Gobert made 11-of-13 from the field for 25 points with 14 rebounds, one steal and four blocks in 31 minutes during a 132-111 win in New Orleans on Saturday. It was like he was playing college kids with easy shots around the rim all night, and owning the paint on defense.  Gobert has been automatic with the ball, making 76.9% from the field with a respectable 71.9% from the line to get him to a 78.2 TS% on his 15.5 usage rate. He's also playing at a 105.0 pace, so this could be Gobert's best year yet."
"Sam Dekker started for Kevin Love (foot) on Saturday vs. Indiana, scoring six points with five rebounds, one assist and two steals in 24 minutes. He was 3-of-7 from the field with no turnovers. Love has missed two games in a row with foot soreness and the 0-6 Cavaliers will be patient with him, but we don't see a reason to pick up Dekker yet. Larry Nance looks like the big winner."
"Ricky Rubio scored 28 points with six rebounds, 12 assists, one steal and three 3-pointers in 30 minutes against the Pelicans on Saturday. He needed this one after a putrid 21.9% from the field in his first four. Anyone who has owned Rubio in the past will tell you all about his dreadful starts over the last few years, but picked up speed down the home stretch like Seabiscuit. Rubio should hold mid-round value on the year and the extra pace could help his ceiling."
"J.R. Smith played six minutes on Saturday vs. the Pacers, scoring three points with one rebound and one assist. Cavaliers coach Ty Lue is on record saying he wants to get Smith more involved, but the front office wants him to focus on the younger guys. It’s pretty obvious that Smith isn’t going to be useful in fantasy leagues any time soon."
"David Nwaba scored a season-high seven points vs. the Pacers on Saturday, adding one rebound, one block and one triple in 14 minutes. He played a total of six minutes across two appearances prior to Saturday, so he’s still irrelevant in all fantasy leagues. As bad as Cleveland has been, this could set Nwaba up for more run as we get closer to the new year."
