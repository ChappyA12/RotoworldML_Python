,"Williams has six assists in 25 minutes since being activated, and did not committ a turnover in 12 minutes of action against Sacramento. He's more poised and controlled than when the season started. Charlie Ward returns from the IL Sunday, though, so even if Williams can avoid heading back to the IL (Lavor Postell is the better choice), his playing time isn't going to improve."
,"Trenton Hassell received another start in place of Robinson, who is day-to-day."
,"According to a police report, Strickland refused to provide information about the accident when questioned by police. The report did not state who was driving his car at the time."
,"Thomas' eye has been swollen shut for two days. He's day-to-day."
,"For now, it appears that coach Nate McMillan prefers both Jerome James and Vitaly Potapenko to Campbell.  Throw in starting center Predrag Drobnjak and that makes Campbell a fourth-stringer."
,"Adonal Foyle has been outplaying Dampier for a few games now and might be close to taking over the starting job.  Bench Dampier if you haven't done so already."
,"Murphy shot just 1-for-8, but it doesn't look like there is any reason to be worried about him."
,"Jamison has been struggling lately, averaging 17 points over his last six games, well below his season average of 22.  That includes tonight's nine point effort as well as games where he was held to six and zero points."
,""
,"He was previously listed as day-to-day."
,"He was 0-for-3 with two points and one board, so his ankle is probably still bothering him."
,"He also hit one of his five treys at the end of regulation to send it to overtime, and hit 11-of-20 shots tonight. He remains hot as he scored 29 in his previous game."
,"A huge crowd was on hand for Asian-American Night, but Ming only took two shots in his first trip to the city of Boston. It seems like he is having more quiet nights lately, and he may not be able to stay on the pace he set in the first half of the year. However, he should be fine over the long haul, with the occasional off night."
,"Person has been improving steadily since returning on February 13, and should be an effective three-point and scoring threat as long as he stays healthy.  He shot well tonight, hitting 9-of-17 overall and 6-of-10 from behind the arc."
,"He had averaged 17 points in his first two games after being traded from the Magic and should be considered day-to-day."
,"Marbury had been in the zone for a long time and was due to have an off night.  Don't expect to see another game like this from him anytime soon.  Despite the scoring and shooting woes, he still picked up nine assists."
,"Jalen did not shoot well from the floor, not making his first shot until the second half.  While he was just 4-of-16 from the field, he hit 11-of-12 free throws.  The 14 boards were a season high and the 11 assists were his second highest total this year.  Jalen has really developed into a fantasy stud, consistently producing in several categories."
,"He was in foul trouble from the outset, but looked good when he was on the floor, going 6-of-10.  It looks like he may be the permanent starter at power forward for the Bulls now, so it may be time to pick him up.  It appears the Bulls are going to see what their young guys can do the rest of the way and it didn't hurt that they beat the Suns tonight."
,"Despite coming off the bench and having a bad back, Marshall made the most of his time on the floor by collecting two blocks, two steals and two assists as well.  He also played twice as many minutes as starter Eddy Curry, due to Curry's foul trouble.  Marshall wore his hair in a huge, vintage Dr. J style afro, but said after the game that it was the last time we'd see it.  He just did it to ''get out of a funk.''  Apparently it worked."
,"If you were wondering if Sam Cassell and The Glove could function together, you have your answer.  Cassell finished with 18 points and seven assists as the two now make up the starting backcourt tandem for the Bucks."
,"Rasho has quietly become a legitimate fantasy center, averaging 17 points and 11 boards a game over his past three.  His block numbers have been very solid as well, although he only had one tonight."
,"Wally has been hot lately, averaging 21.5 points a game over his last nine.  He shot 6-of-12 from the floor tonight and hit all 12 of his free throw attempts."
,"KG collected his league-leading 47th double-double and shot 11-of-19 from the floor.  If Kobe and T-Mac were not going crazy, Garnett would be the talk of the league."
,"This makes two straight games Baker has sat out since the Celtics acquired Mark Blount and Mark Bryant. Baker wasn't on stable ground before the trade deadline, and with two more big men to compete with and the strong play of Tony Battie, his playing time might be gone."
,"While he shot just 7-of-20 from the floor, it looks like he is almost fully recovered from his knee injury."
,"He only grabbed a steal and three boards, but he appears to be the second-string backup to Battie as Vin Baker did not play for his second consecutive game."
,"Bremer has been struggling the last couple weeks, shooting a measley 33% from the floor and averaging just 8.5 points a game over his last seven.  Luckily for Bremer, Tony Delk hasn't been much better."
,"Francis missed his last game with a sore back.  He also added nine rebounds, nine assists and hit two clutch freebies and a break-away dunk in the final 20 seconds to seal the win for the Rockets at the end of overtime."
,"Medical experts said Monday it's unlikely MacCulloch will be able to continue playing with the genetic disorder.  ``It's a progressive disease, and at this time there is no treatment,'' said Dr. Carlos Garcia, a professor of clinical neurology at Tulane. ``Sometimes surgery can help, but I don't believe you can play basketball once you have these types of problems in your feet and your hands.'' MacCulloch likely will remain on Philadelphia's injured list for the rest of the season."
,"He said his elbow started bothering him during Saturday's game against San Antonio and he missed the second half. ''I don't know what happened,'' Artest said Monday. ''It's not bending. I can't shoot.''  Artest might have bone chips causing a problem in the elbow, and if that's the case, he'll probably need surgery."
,"Butler will miss Tuesday's game at San Antonio and likely will sit out Wednesday's game at New Orleans.  Rasual Butler will continue to help fill in for him."
,"Robinson will have to head back to court on March 24."
,"''He's injured. It's obvious,'' the coach said. ''He's not getting the lift and doesn't have the quickness he's had.'' Houston won't be coming out of the lineup, but he has taken 12 and 16 shots the past two games, low numbers for him. And since it's well-documunted that he doesn't offer much to fantasy teams outside of scoring, it may be beneficial to go another route for now."
,"Mark Madsen's play in relief of Walker has been solid, which should ease the decision to be without Samaki for a few more games."
,"''I can't wait until this team is my team, so I can stop some of the stuff that goes on,'' Chandler said. Chandler is finally starting to look and feel like the real deal, and someone the Bulls can build around."
,"That look could be extended depending upon how much time Caron Butler misses with his illness. Lampley is an unproven but promising physical presence fresh off the IL. Riley likes him, and wants to see what he has."
,"Butler was admitted to the hospital on Saturday to replace fluids. No word was available on his condition. Butler doesn't get as much ink as fellow rookies Yao Ming and Amare Stoudemire, but he's a close third to those players in the Rookie of the Year race, if not better. Butler is among the top 10 rookies in points per game (1st), rebounds per game (7th), assists per game (5th), and steals per game (2nd), something neither Yao nor Amare can claim."
,"He will wear a sleeve over his right knee, but is happy to be done with the cumbersome brace. While wearing the brace during February, Walker was below his season averages in both points and rebounds."
,"Barry will continue to start at point guard, with Kevin Ollie backing up."
,"Arenas and the Warriors play in Denver tonight. A large cheering section is expected."
,"Outside of a 23-point game against Memphis, Artest has combined to hit 17-of-67 shots (25 percent) in the other six games and has not been the defensive force he was earlier in the season. Then on Saturday, Artest changed into his street clothes at halftime after going scoreless and reboundless in the first half. He was unavailable for comment afterward, but was said to have a sore right elbow. Consider him day-to-day, but avoid using him until he gets things together."
,"Even so, Eddy Curry may get the start and the bulk of the playing time over Marshall."
,"Juan Dixon, who scored 16 Sunday, will be counted on to replace Hughes' production."
,""They're both playoff-contending teams and would be good situations. Both situations are very appealing to me,'' Whitney said. Orlando had tried to trade for Whitney before the season. Once the Nuggets release Whitney, he would have to clear waivers. He likely won't be waived, though, until he has strong assurances that another team would sign him to a prorated minimum deal for the remainder of the season."
,"It didn't take long for Allen to get comfortable with his new team.  He also had four threes and three steals in the game."
,"Campbell played just 10 minutes in the game.  He won't be an option in fantasy leagues unless he gets into the 25-30 range."
,"He had missed 10 games with the injury.  With Webber back, Keon Clark had only one point and three rebounds in 28 minutes."
,"Glover has kept the starting job at shooting guard even though Ira Newble is back healthy, but he might not hold on to it for much longer.  Glover, who is in the lineup for offense, has averaged four points and shot 6-for-28 over the last four games."
,"Mohammed felt discomfort during last night's game.  He will be examined on Monday to determine whether his right foot is broken again."
,""
,"''He's feeling better, and we're optimistic he will be released Monday,'' Heat spokesman Rob Wilson said.  The Heat next play on Tuesday.  Butler's status for the game is uncertain."
,"The diagnosis doesn't help clarify when MacCulloch will return to action.  ``There is no definite ruling on his career or on this season,'' Sixers GM Billy King said.  MacCulloch is scheduled to see a specialist tomorrow."
,"It's the third time in eight days that he's established a new season high for points in a game.  Szczerbiak also had eight assists, six rebounds, three treys and two steals today."
,"Coincidentally, McGrady's first triple-double came exactly one year ago today."
,"Sasser missed two games with neck and back spasms."
,"It was just Kidd's third triple-double of the season.  He's one away from 50 for his career."
,"The Mavs went small most of the game, so both LaFrentz and Shawn Bradley (no points in 17 minutes) spent a lot of time on the bench."
,"Stackhouse was clearly less than 100 percent in the previous two games, but he looked better today.  To go along with the 30 points, he had seven rebounds, six assists and no turnovers."
,"Thomas is day-to-day."
,"''It felt real good today,'' said Webber, who has missed the past 10 games with a sprained ankle. ''There (are) still a lot of things I'm not able to do. But as far as being able to move and things like that, it felt good. We'll see what happens in the morning, and we'll kind of take it from there.''"
,"O'Neal believes he may have to play through the problems for the rest of the season, but he's willing to do that.  Expect him to start tonight against Seattle."
,""
,""
,"Rebraca, who has been on the injured list since Jan. 6 because of an irregular heartbeat, has not worked out much with the team. Pistons president Joe Dumars said that a decision regarding Rebraca's playing condition for the rest of the season would made soon."
,"Wallace finished with two points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots."
,"Whitney is likely to be waived by the Nuggets this week, allowing him to catch on with a playoff contender.  The move would have to be made by Saturday, or Whitney would be ineligible to go to the playoffs with a new team."
,"Mutombo should return in mid-March."
,"Ward will have to sit out four more games before he can be activated."
,"An MRI will be performed on Monday.  Bender, who tore the calf in December, was activated from the injured list last week but played in just one game."
,"Gasol had an awful night, finishing with six points and three boards.  Expect him to bounce back next time out."
,"O'Neal started the game wearing a mask to protect the injury he suffered in Thursday's loss at New Jersey, but he discarded it after just a few minutes and a few missed shots. ''I couldn't breathe in it,'' he said. ''Hopefully I can get a new mask. That and a good night's sleep in my own bed should help.'' He finished with 12 points on 4-of-15 shooting before leaving the game with 9:28 left."
,"X-rays were negative, but his eye was swollen shut yesterday."
,"Francis thinks he'll be ready to play.  He wanted to start last night, but sitting out was the smart thing for him to do."
,"Consider Taylor day-to-day."
,"Maggette is day-to-day."
,"Richardson, who had missed Wednesday's game with a cold, got the start against the Hawks because Corey Maggette was out."
,"That line looks pretty familiar.  Payton played 41 minutes, which is exactly what he averaged for the Sonics."
,"Cassell remains in the starting lineup, so Michael Redd will continue to come off the bench for now.  Redd had 17 points in 27 minutes against Portland."
,"Since the Bucks weren't able to trade Sam Cassell, it's unlikely that Mason is going to have any fantasy value over the rest of the season."
,"Wells had been struggling to score earlier this month, but he's found his game now."
,"Massenburg had two points."
,"Camby sat out Wednesday's game to rest his sprained right ankle."
,"Whitney just might get his wish to be waived.  Junior Harrington got the start over Williams against Utah and had 16 points and three assists in 39 minutes.  Williams had 13 points and six assists in 29 minutes."
,"Robinson had nine points, five rebounds and two blocks."
,"Duncan also had 10 rebounds and five blocks."
,"Artest failed to score in 13 minutes before departing."
,"It's his first missed contest of the season.  Francis had been bothered by the back condition in Houston's three previous games. He'll be re-evaluated prior to Monday's game.  Moochie Norris started in Francis' place tonight and had nine points and nine assists in 40 minutes."
,"Posey had eight points, eight rebounds and five assists in 21 minutes before departing."
,"Anderson had three assists and committed three fouls."
,"Allen has had some good games this season, but he's not an option in fantasy leagues.  Before tonight, he was averaging just 9.0 points and 4.6 rebounds per game this month."
,"Curry has made a lot of progress over the last few games.  If you have an open bench spot, consider picking him up."
,"No consistency from Williams.  Things will have to get better over the final two months of the season, but Williams isn't a quality fantasy point guard right now."
,"Jones missed four games with a strained left groin."
,"Trenton Hassell started in Robinson's place, but he played just 17 minutes due to foul trouble."
,"Butler left Miami's practice Friday after feeling ill.  Consider him day-to-day."
,"The Heat are going with Mike James as Travis Best's backup."
,"Lampley had missed the last 15 games with a lower lumbar strain.  He shouldn't get much playing time."
,"Knight will battle Earl Watson for minutes backing up Jason Williams."
,"Humphrey was acquired from the Magic in Tuesday's trade."
,"Robinson is expected to play tonight.  His return will take minutes away from Malik Rose and Kevin Willis."
,"Wilks has averaged 2.5 points and 2.6 assists in six games with Minnesota.  He will fall to third on the depth chart at point guard once Rod Strickland returns."
,"Yeah, just like Kobe Bryant's knee tendinitis is bothering him. McGrady scored 52 last night. The NBA should give all of its players tendinitis. McGrady did wear bands on both knees last night, and said after the game that his ''knees have been on fire lately.'' With similarly-skilled players like McGrady, Bryant, and Vince Carter having the same knee problems, the injury is becoming known as ''Jumper's Knee.'' Even though it's not good for business, you have to wonder if some superstars should go easy on the high-flying act to preserve their longevity."
,"Francis' back is really hurting him. If he's out for any length of time, the Rockets' chances of beating out the Lakers for the eighth playoff spot become almost nil."
,"Thomas has had the team go without a point guard for lengthy stretches of the fourth quarter over the last three games (all losses). Jamaal Tinsley could play less often and backup point guard Erick Strickland might not play at all in some games to get Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Bender on the court more often. Thomas explains it: ''Do I take those guys off the floor to play a traditional point guard when they rebound better, shoot better, defend better?'' Okay, but a fourth-straight loss tonight in San Antonio might spell the end of that strategy."
,"Houston played 40 minutes, scoring 17 points with three each of rebounds, assists, and steals."
,"This just makes it official."
,"The trio took their physicals Thursday before flying back to Milwaukee to attend to personal business."
,""
,"Hill would like to go somewhere he could have a chance to win and contribute. ''I respect the direction they're going and I've done everything they've asked me to do, but they want me to bend over backwards even more,'' Hill said. Hill has not played since Feb. 2, supposedly because of a back contusion. He's still a quality rebounder, averaging 8.3 boards per game, nearly his career average of 8.7."
,"Coach Paul Silas said he will play Anderson a limited amount of minutes in tonight's game at Detroit."
,"Wesley said the joint loosened up during the game. The 35 points were the most he has scored as a member of the Hornets."
,"Maggette will be a game-time decision for tonight's contest. If he can't play, Keyon Dooling and Quentin Richardson, who didn't play Wednesday with minor ailments, are both probable for tonight and would help replace Maggette."
,"Ely is a better option than Sean Rooks or Cherokee Parks to replace the injured Michael Olowokandi, but the Clippers prefer to bring him off the bench. Next year, however, with Olowokandi probably gone to free agency, Ely stands a good chance of being the starting center on this club."
,"Pippen has mentioned the possibility before, but this was the first time his former coach has discussed it. Jackson said it would be a ''longshot,'' but also said, ''obviously we know what his status is, and when that time comes, we will certainly talk about it.''"
,"Arenas willed Golden State to a four-point win over the Knicks, as the Warriors went on a 16-2 run in the fourth quarter."
,""
,"It's probably best to observe Jones this weekend and consider activating him for next week."
,"The 16 points is a season high."
,"Good news for Barry owners.  ``I think we probably will have to start off with Brent at the point until (Kevin) Ollie and Ray (Allen) get accustomed our offensive sets,'' coach Nate McMillan said. ``I think Brent still feels comfortable playing off the ball, but he is able to run that spot.''"
,"O'Neal missed three games because of a sore left knee and right big toe."
,"Walker is day-to-day."
,"Barry really helped his case with this performance.  He should continue to see time at point guard for Seattle, but Kevin Ollie could start at the position."
,"The Bucks were awful in their first game without Ray Allen, scoring just 58 points and losing by 30 to a weakened Sonics team.  Redd's going to have to step up if he wants to continue to play big minutes."
,"Foyle also had 10 rebounds and kept Erick Dampier on the bench for much of the second half."
,"Thomas also had eight rebounds and four assists."
,"Big surprise.  Dickerson had three points in 10 minutes before departing."
,"Mashburn tied his career high.  He also scored 50 points against Chicago on Nov. 22, 1994."
,"Magloire should benefit from not having Elden Campbell around, but he'll probably remain inconsistent.  Don't expect games like this every night."
,"Haston didn't score, but he did pick up two fouls."
,"He might not have played so much had Shane Battier not gotten into foul trouble.  If Miller continues to come off the bench, he might not be worth using in fantasy leagues."
,"Nowitzki also had 11 rebounds."
,"Francis had been questionable for the game."
,""
,"Wilks' first 10-day contract expires tomorrow.  He had no points and three assists in 15 minutes tonight."
,"Well, at least Booth has just four years left on his $34 million contract.  He is averaging just 2.6 points and 1.7 rebounds in 38 appearances off the bench this season."
,"The Sonics needed to clear roster room as a result of yesterday's trades."
,"Iverson added six assists and four steals in 41 minutes."
,""
,"Milt Palacio, who had been starting at point guard, played 30 minutes off the bench.  Wagner might have some value now that he's back starting, but keep him benched for now."
,"Thomas had two points in five minutes before leaving."
,"With the Magic up by 21 after three, McGrady sat out the entire fourth quarter.  McGrady was 15-of-32 from the field, 6-of-13 from long distance and 16-of-20 from the line to eclipse the 50 points he scored last season against Washington. McGrady finished one point shy of the Magic franchise record of 53 set by Shaquille O'Neal in 1993-94."
,"Nice.  Expect quality numbers from Gooden for the rest of the year."
,"It looks like Giricek, who started at small forward, will have some fantasy value with Orlando.  However, he will face some competition for playing time once Jeryl Sasser returns."
,"More surprising is that Williams was 10-for-10 from the line and 21-for-24 over the last three games.  Before his recent streak, he was just 57-for-101 for the season."
,"Bradley had been out with a sore lower back."
,"He was 0-of-11 in the first half.  Marion tried to make up for his poor shooting night in other ways, contributing 12 rebounds, three blocks and three steals."
,"Thomas was taken in for X-rays, the results of which aren't yet known."
,"Jordan was already the oldest player ever to score 40 points.  He had 43 in 43 minutes tonight."
,"Howard Eisley should play 35 minutes per game while Ward is out, so if he's available in your league, pick him up.  Latrell Sprewell could also get minutes at point guard."
,"Williams will help back up Howard Eisley until Charlie Ward is ready to return."
,"Nachbar, who had been on the active roster all season, has played in just 13 games, averaging 2.1 points."
,"Team spokeswoman Julie Fie wouldn't say what rule Stoudemire broke.  Stoudemire entered the game with three minutes left in the first quarter."
,"Wolkowski is heading to Europe to play with a team in Spain."
,"Gugliotta takes Penny Hardaway's spot on the roster.  He'll back up Amare Stoudemire at power forward.  Don't expect his presence to have too much of a negative impact on Stoudemire's value."
,"Williams, who averaged 13.2 points for Huntsville of the National Basketball Developmental League, has played in the NBA with Golden State (1997-98) and San Antonio (1998-99).  He's not going to have any fantasy value."
,"Mason had been on the injured list since the start of the season after undergoing shoulder surgery.  He probably won't play more than 5-10 minutes per game."
,"Brunson might be Chicago's most effective point guard right now, but the Bulls are better off using Jay Williams and Jamal Crawford."
,"A complaint was filed by the woman after the Wizards' road game against the Utah Jazz on Feb. 14. No charges have been filed. ``The organization has spoken with Jahidi, and we believe that the allegations have no merit,'' Wizards spokesman Matt Williams said Friday."
,"The same goes for the rest of the players included in yesterday's deal.  The Sonics may dress only eight players tonight as a result of the deal and could use Brent Barry and Vladimir Radmanovic as their starting guards."
,"MacCulloch's nerve damage has made him, in Brown's words, physically unable to perform."
,"Hence the acquisition of Kenny Anderson from Seattle."
,"Atlanta has two open spots on their roster, and plan to fill the second with a guard. They are waiting to see if Minnesota decides to keep Mike Wilks, whose 10-day contract expires in two days."
,"Whitney understands that the team wants to get good looks at Junior Harrington and newly-acquired Shammond Williams. Playing time will be at a premium, but Whitney, who will be a free agent after the season, feels like his stock will suffer if he's not on the floor regularly."
,""
,"The Cavs would like Miles to work with other frontcourt players who live in Cleveland -- Zydrunas Ilguaskas & Carlos Boozer among them -- to be better prepared for next season."
,"Gooden's 12.1 points and 5.8 rebounds should increase with his new role in Orlando."
,"Rookie Frank Williams will be activated and take over as the backup point guard tonight. Latrell Sprewell will also see some time at the point while Ward is out when the Knicks go to a big backcourt alignment. Coach Don Chaney thinks Ward may ''be out a while.''"
,"Francis sat out the fourth quarter of the last game, saying his back was ''on fire.'' The back is stiff and sore; team trainers will examine it today before making a decision."
,"The Warriors are believed to be interested in Crawford, since it's possible they will lose Gilbert Arenas in free agency. The Wizards are also thought to be looking at Crawford."
,"Coach Bill Cartwright said that reuniting Chandler and Curry in the starting lineup is a ''definite possibility'' by next week, a move made easier because a banged-up Donyell Marshall is struggling. Chandler has already established some nice fantasy value. Curry and Williams aren't likely to show much over the remainder of this season, but the Bulls view the trio as their future."
,"The woman alleges that White sexually assaulted her in the team hotel during the Wizards' trip to Utah last week. Salt Lake police are investigating, and say it might be two weeks before a decision to file charges is made. A Wizards' spokesman said the organization, after talking with White, believes the allegations have no merit."
,"Thomas is the backup to Brendan Haywood at center. He shouldn't miss much time."
,"Rookie Juan Dixon will be thrust into backup point guard duty while Hughes is out."
,"Artest got the flagrant foul after grabbing a rebound and raising his elbow to the head of Nets center Aaron Williams. Artest added a fourth-quarter technical for throwing a ball into the back of referee Bennie Adams."
,"Christie also had three steals and three treys in one of his best games of the season."
,"Wallace had been out with a right quad contusion."
,"Duncan's eye was swollen and remained sore after the game, but Spurs officials said there were no scratches or other damage.  He should be fine for San Antonio's next game."
,"Webber has been out since Jan. 28 with a sprained left ankle."
,"It appears that Cassell will be staying in Milwaukee, but he doesn't figure to be happy as a backup.  The Bucks will give him minutes at shooting guard, so he could still have a little fantasy value."
,"Nowitzki played 38 minutes and also contributed two steals, two blocks and two threes."
,"Rose isn't starting, but he has been a very productive player during David Robinson's absence."
,"Kidd is breaking out of his shooting slump.  He was 10-of-16 tonight and 2-of-3 from long range.  Over the last three games, he's 22-of-39 from the field."
,"Robinson was arrested in July 2002 on charges of domestic battery, assault and illegal possession of a firearm.  The warrant is only good in Illinois, but the Hawks play in Chicago later this month, so Robinson will have to settle the matter before then."
,"The Sonics will get either a 2003 first-round draft pick or two 2003 second-round draft picks.  Allen's value shouldn't change in Seattle.  He'll get at least as many minutes and shots as he did with the Bucks.  Allen's arrival could be bad news for Brent Barry, but since the Sonics are also losing Mason, Barry should continue to get quite a bit of playing time."
,"Assuming that Sam Cassell is gone, this trade shouldn't have much of an impact on Payton's numbers.  He'll continue to get his 20 points and nine assists per game.  If Cassell stays in Milwaukee, Payton might play a few less minutes per game than usual.  He'd remain a very productive fantasy point guard, however."
,"Mason is definitely hurt by this trade and he could be a complete non-factor if the Bucks end up acquiring Latrell Sprewell.  As things stand now, he'd already have quite a battle on his hands.  Michael Redd is likely to replace Ray Allen as the team's starting shooting guard and the Bucks still have Toni Kukoc to back up Tim Thomas at small forward."
,""
,""
,"Ollie will split time with Brent Barry at point guard for Seattle.  Barry appears to be the better option in fantasy leagues right now, but that could change."
,"Murray had played in just 12 games with Milwaukee and spent the six weeks on the team's injured list.  He isn't likely to be a part of Seattle's rotation."
,"The Bucks don't need Cassell now that they have Gary Payton.  A deal would make sense, though whether today's events will really improve either the Bucks or the Knicks remains to be seen."
,"Walker was injured during last night's game.  With Shaq expected back, the Lakers can afford to give him a night off."
,"O'Neal, who has missed three games with a sore knee, said following a light workout Thursday he plans on playing tomorrow."
,"Griffin's injury will result in a little more playing time for Raja Bell and Eduardo Najera."
,"Johnson will act as the Mavericks' third-string point guard."
,"Payton figures to be Milwaukee's Nick Van Exel.  He'll back up Payton and split time with Michael Redd at shooting guard."
,"Bender will take some minutes away from Al Harrington and Ron Mercer.  He has no fantasy value."
,"Jones, Indy's No. 3 point guard, won't be activated until another one of Indiana's players gets hurt."
,"Until Baron Davis returns, Anderson will split time at point guard with David Wesley.  He shouldn't have any fantasy value.  With Campbell gone, Jamaal Magloire should play a few more minutes per game, boosting his value."
,"Campbell is sure to get more minutes with the Sonics, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he'll have any fantasy value.  Keep an eye on him."
,"Blount spent two years with the Celtics before signing with the Denver in the summer.  He'll act as the team's third-string center and could see quite a bit of playing time if Tony Battie goes down again."
,"Bryant, who has scored 13 points in 14 games this season, had been on Denver's injured list.  He's not going to have much of a role on the Celtics."
,"Even though Payton is gone, the Sonics decided that they wanted another big man instead of Anderson.  Both players are free agents after the season."
,"The Bucks will also get Desmond Mason.  Going to Seattle along with Payton are Kevin Ollie and Joel Przybilla."
,"If Hughes can't play, both Tyronn Lue and Juan Dixon will get extra minutes."
,"Robinson's knee is improving, but he is not expected to play Saturday, either. Spurs officials believe he can return Tuesday."
,"Oddly enough, Terry doesn't make ''enough money'' to allow the Hawks to make a big deal involving him."
,"Nowitzki missed two games in December with a sprain of the same ankle. If he can't go, Eduardo Najera or Shawn Bradley would start in his place."
,"Grant is fifth in the NBA in rebounding. If a deal goes through, the Mavericks would also receive either Travis Best or Eddie House. Miami would receive Nick Van Exel and a frontcourt player, probably Evan Eschmeyer. Of all the players involved, Van Exel would stand to get the biggest boost in fantasy value as he would become Miami's starting point guard."
,"Skinner sat out last night's game but said that the doctor's report was encouraging and that he will try to practice today."
,"The Knicks have been a much-rumored destination for Croshere, but there are many other permutations and possibilities."
,"Anderson must sit out the next two games, but could be activated for Monday. The only problem is finding space for him on the active roster. Joseph Forte is the obvious choice, but he has already told the team he wouldn't go to the IL once this year."
,"Harvey's name has come up in trade talks with the Celtics and Heat, even though the Denver Post believes both scenarios are unlikely."
,"Smith has been out since the end of January with an ankle injury."
,"Brandon's career may be over, but he has a large expiring contract. Minnesota coach Flip Saunders, however, says he can't see Pat Riley trading a quality player for someone who may never play again."
,"''I felt like someone kneed me in the pelvic area,'' said Ward, who had two points in thirteen minutes. Ward isn't certain when he can play again. Consider him day-to-day."
,"With Richardson out, Corey Maggette and Eric Piatkowski combined for 36 points."
,"Dooling is day-to-day."
,"It would be nice if Redd got a few more minutes per game, but as long as he keeps sinking threes, he's a decent option in fantasy leagues."
,""
,"Barry scored six points.  Mason had nine in 31 minutes off the bench.  If you've had Barry benched, it's safe to use him again now that he's starting.  Mason should continue to have some value."
,"Lewis missed one game with a sprained right ankle."
,"Wells, who also had four steals in the contest, had been in a scoring slump this month, averaging just 10.1 points per game."
,"Golden State was down 27 at halftime, so all of the team's starters got a break.  Mike Dunleavy played the most of anyone on the team and scored 14 points in 32 minutes."
,"E-Rob has to be in danger of losing his job.  If he's not scoring, he shouldn't be playing."
,"Skinner's absence helped lead to Kenny Thomas's big game."
,"Harrington had five points and three assists in 31 minutes.  Neither of Denver's point guards have any fantasy value at the moment."
,"Chandler is averaging 17.6 points and 13.6 rebounds per game during the stretch.  Were you patient and held onto Chandler?  You are being rewarded."
,"Great game for Iverson, who is shooting 40% on the season."
,"Thomas had a huge day, making 9-of-11 shots from the field and collecting 3 steals and 2 blocks."
,"Massenburg is day-to-day."
,"Bryant has scored 40 or more in seven straight games and has at least 35 in his last 11.  He made 15-of-29 shot attempts tonight."
,"McKie had been out with a separated left shoulder."
,"Gugliotta has been out with a broken foot."
,"Rice made 8-of-11 shots, including 7-of-8 3-point attempts, in 25 minutes off the bench.  This was Rice's second game since returning from the injured list.  If you need 3-pointers, Rice is an excellent option and may be available in your league."
,"Yarbrough also made 2 3-pointers and collected 4 assists."
,"Camby had missed this past Sunday's game with a sprained right ankle."
,"Strickland is out with a strained left groin."
,"This is good to see as we've been waiting for a big game from Wally.  He's underperformed so far this season, and is bound for a good second half."
,"Haston had just been activated from the injured list four days ago."
,"Magloire is averaging 9.4 points and 8.2 rebounds per game this season."
,"Stackhouse, who had been out with a groin injury, was rather ineffective, making only 6-of-15 shot attempts, 3-of-6 free throws, and doing very little of the other things (1 rebound, 1 block, 0 steals, 0 assists, 0 3-pointers)."
,"Hamilton kills you on nights like tonight because he did nothing else to make him valuable.  He also collected 1 rebound, 1 steal, and nothing else."
,"On the bright side, Carter did the little things.  He also had 6 boards, 8 assists, 4 blocks and a steal.  Even so, we have yet to see the Vince of old since he's returned from injury."
,""
,"Gooden will take over as Orlando's power forward and should put up quality numbers for the rest of the season.  If he's available in your league, pick him up.  With Miller gone, Pat Garrity will play a lot of small forward."
,"Giricek will replace Matt Miller for the Magic and could have a little fantasy value over the final two months.  Wait and see how he performs with his new team before you consider picking him up."
,"The Grizzlies didn't think Gooden was a fit as a small forward.  Miller should be, but his fantasy value drops quite a bit with this trade.  He'll battle Shane Battier, Wesley Person and Michael Dickerson for minutes at small forward and shooting guard."
,"Humphrey, a first-round pick in this year's draft, didn't play much in Orlando, averaging 1.8 points in 35 games.  Don't expect things to change now that he's in Memphis."
,"Williams has played in just four games this season because of shoulder and knee injuries.  He'll be used as a reserve at small forward."
,"The Mavericks said that Nowitzki would be a game-time decision.  If he can't play, both Shawn Bradley and Raef LaFrentz would get more minutes."
,"Dampier started last night (some fans booed) and had six points, three rebounds, and three blocks in 20 minutes. He, along with Danny Fortson and Adonal Foyle, has been mentioned frequently in trade rumors this week."
,"Consider Dooling day-to-day."
,"Bradley says he still isn't 100 percent, but feels like he can contribute. He's averaging 4.1 points and 4.9 rebounds this season."
,"Brown is already valuable as a consistent rebounder, but he also contributes heavily in leagues that use shooting percentages."
,"Coach Paul Silas is hopeful Alexander can return after a couple of days."
,"There were some lesser players included in the proposal, but it's not likely that the Knicks will be able to find a way to make the package more intriguing to the Sonics."
,"O'Neal is expected to play Friday, after missing three games, including tonight's game against Utah."
,"The Celtics will save about $200,000 by releasing Wolkowyski, who has played a grand total of 24 minutes for them. The move will once again take the Celtics down to the minimum 12-man roster. GM Chris Wallace said ''we'll have to see what's out there'' in regards to adding a 13th player."
,"If necessary, this would be the fourth surgery on Hill's left ankle. A determination will be made following X-rays on the ankle next week. In the meantime, Hill says he's still hopeful of returning for the playoffs, if the Magic can get there without him."
,"Sasser is day-to-day."
,"Think Sprewell will be traded? Neither do we..."
,"Philadelphia has made a deadline deal in four of the last five years, so look for one of the following possibilities to occur: Theo Ratliff from Atlanta could happen, but might require a third team to facilitate it. Adonal Foyle and Chris Mills could come over from Golden State, but it's not certain what the Sixers would give up. There is still a possibility Keith Van Horn and Greg Buckner could be headed to New York for Latrell Sprewell and Othella Harrington.The Heat, who could part with Brian Grant or Travis Best, are also a potential trade partner."
,"One insider, however, said Dallas owner Mark Cuban is trying to block the deal because he wants his friend, Denver GM Kiki Vandeweghe, to be able to acquire Arenas as a free agent this summer. If the Warriors are not below the salary cap, they can only offer Arenas the midlevel exception."
,"The Heat want at least $5 million in expiring contracts for Jones. The Bulls would like to acquire the shooting guard, but their only tradeable player in the final year of his contract is $1.4 million Fred Hoiberg. The Bulls might still be able to get Jones by including Eddie Robinson and Marcus Fizer, but the Heat continue to listen to a plethora of offers."
,"Mason had shoulder surgery over the summer and has yet to make his NBA debut. It's possible that his pending return means the Bulls are about to deal Jamal Crawford, but more likely that they just want to see what they have in Mason over the remainder of the season."
,"Stackhouse missed the past five games with a pulled left groin but was cleared on Friday."
,"By our calculations, Kobe is now averaging 723.3 points per game this month."
,"Taylor is playing well enough to prevent Eddie Griffin from having any fantasy value.  Griffin played just 17 minutes against the Lakers."
,"Posey had two points in 23 minutes in Houston's 2OT loss to the Lakers.  It looks like neither Rice nor Posey are going to have any fantasy value while the other is healthy."
,"McCarty and J.R. Bremer (22 points, six threes) both had big games to push the Celtics over the Warriors.  McCarty was 8-of-10 shooting and 5-of-6 from three-point land."
,"Battie came off the bench Sunday in his first game back from the flu."
,"Jamison entered the game averaging just 16 points and 5.3 rebounds per game this month."
,"Divac has always produced nice numbers during Chris Webber's absences.  The 19 rebounds were a season high."
,"Kukoc got some extra minutes with Anthony Mason out.  If only he played 30 minutes every night, he'd have quite a bit of fantasy value."
,"Gasol's February got off to a bit of a slow start, but he is averaging 22.7 points and 10.7 rebounds over the last three games."
,"Miller had a little extra fuel in the tank tonight, courtesy of his ejection in the first quarter of Sunday's game."
,"Bowen is knocking down 47 percent of his shots this season, which is far over his career average.  However, he's still scoring just 7.1 points per game."
,"Camby missed Sunday's game due to his sprained right ankle."
,"Martin is averaging 20.7 points per game this month."
,"It looks like the Magic are going to continue to use DeClercq as their starting center, but the University of Florida product doesn't have any fantasy value."
,"With Sasser out, Mike Miller played all 48 minutes against the Hornets and scored 24 points."
,"Humphrey probably wouldn't have played anyway."
,"Williams didn't do much other than score, finishing with four assists, two rebounds and nothing else.  Still, this could qualify as his best game of the month."
,"It's Boozer's first double-double of the month.  The rookie forward has had some very good games this season, but consistency has been a big problem for him.  He's been averaging well under 30 minutes per game over the last month, and that's preventing him from being a decent option in fantasy leagues."
,"With Mason out, the Bucks likely will use Tim Thomas and Jason Caffey at power forward, opening up more minutes for Toni Kukoc and Michael Redd."
,"Rice missed more than a month with a left shoulder strain.  He'll battle James Posey for minutes at small forward."
,"O'Neal is expected to miss a second game due to a sore left knee."
,"Rice has been out since mid-January with torn shoulder cartilage, and while he averaged 9.2 points per game before getting hurt, he may have to settle for a leadership role backing up James Posey down the stretch."
,"Coach Nate McMillan says James' status has yet to be determined. James showed up 75 minutes late to Monday's practice, while Drobnjak scored 23 points in Saturday's game."
,"The agent, Bill Pollak, says he doubts McCloud will sign anywhere before Thursday's trade deadline."
,"Unidentified sources also say that there are at least two other teams making better offers to Seattle for Payton's services."
,"Riley also said Jones' replacement, Eddie House, will have to earn future playing opportunities by enhancing his game past being merely a shooter. House has started the last three games but, once Jones returns, may have to sit a while."
,"Smart move. Jaric has talent, the Clippers aren't going anywhere, and Gentry has to look at the guys who won't be leaving via free agency. Gentry may even go so far as to cut into Andre Miller's minutes, even with games on the line to give Jaric a look. Jaric has averaged 7.3 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2.9 assists per game, and is a sleeper for steals; he's third in the NBA in steals per 48 minutes."
,"Parks was recently activated from the IL, and had 14 points in 32 minutes Saturday. Sean Rooks, with 3.2 points and 3.4 rebounds per game in February, has not been the answer as the starting center in Michael Olowokandi's absence. Parks can't help but do better than that, but he won't have a lick of fantasy value."
,"Kupchak said it ''would be unlikely'' for the Lakers to look at Horace Grant or Stanley Roberts, saying he doesn't think there's a player out there that would be the key to a championship run."
,"The official word is that O'Neal will be a game-time decision with a knee injury. He reports no improvement in the knee or his bothersome toe."
,"The Nuggets covet Arenas, and will have about $18 million to spend on free agents. Arenas is on a hot streak, averaging 24.8 points over his last 10 games, and winning the MVP of the Rookie Challenge game. As a second-round pick, Arenas, who makes just over $500,000, will be an ''early bird'' free agent. Golden State will get the chance to match a minimum three-year offer to Arenas, who said he'd ''consider anything.''"
,"Coach Frank Johnson said ''there's a chance'' Gugliotta could be activated for Wednesday's game against Houston. Gugliotta will practice full court today and said he could be available for emergency duty Wednesday, but he expects to wait until Friday. Amare Stoudemire has taken Googs' job at power forward, however, Gugliotta might get the chance to play alongside Stoudemire. With Jake Tsakalidis out, Stoudemire could slide over to center."
,"The move was made to make room for Tom Gugliotta. Look for Penny to return sometime in early March."
,"Houston had four threes for the third game in a row."
,"Malone, who scored 18 of his points in the second half, also collected 9 rebounds and 6 assists.  He seems to be rebounding from a sluggish start."
,"Hudson is averaging just over 9 assists over his last 5 games."
,"Garnett also collected 6 assists, a steal, and a block."
,"Wallace had 9 defensive rebounds in the third quarter alone, one shy of the team record set by Wallace himself."
,"Hamilton made 14-of-22 shots, including 2 3-pointers.  Even more amazingly, Rip collected 4 rebounds and 3 assists!"
,"Carter had been out with left knee tendinitis."
,"''I'm hurting. I'm getting old,'' Kobe said through a smile as he limped through the locker room with the knee wrapped in ice. Yeah, five 40-point games in a row will do that to you."
,"Shaq missed Sunday's game with the knee injury, but the Lakers did not order further tests, X-ray or MRI."
,"Alexander strained his left groin in the second quarter last night and did not return. Consider him day-to-day."
,"With Carter and Eddie Jones out, Travis Best and Mike James are receiving more minutes than usual."
,"Jones remains day-to-day."
,"Wolkowyski is the last man on the Celtics roster, and remains on the IL. After talking to the Euro teams, his ''agent called me and said I'm not leaving. I'm staying here.''"
,"McKie went through pregame drills Sunday morning before determining that he would be a detriment to the team if he tried to play.Neither coach Larry Brown nor McKie would venture to guess when McKie would return to the lineup."
,"Whitney will therefore be an unrestricted free agent following the season."
,"Such a deal wouldn't work because the salaries don't match up, but a source close to the situation said the Nuggets would consider throwing in another player if Boston included a draft pick. For Blount's part, he would welcome the chance to play for Boston. Denver GM Kiki Vandeweghe had no comment on the rumor."
,"Gabriel went on to say he doesn't envision any scenarios involving Hill."
,"For now, Wesley Person and Dickerson look like they'll share the shooting guard position."
,"The Sixers would get a quasi-center to replace Todd MacCulloch, as well as Barry's versatile perimeter game. The Sonics would benefit with cap room from Coleman's expiring contract."
,"Neither player has any value, but Johnson hasn't held back his disappointment, which could be a distraction."
,"Houston's previous career high was 44 points against Milwaukee on Jan. 12, 2002.  He had five assists, four threes and two steals in the game."
,"It's no surprise to see Fisher do more scoring with Shaq out, but the eight assists, one short of his season high, were rather unexpected given the circumstances."
,"The All-Star break appears to have done Stoudamire some good.  He's averaging 20.7 points and 14.7 rebounds in three games since the the festivities."
,"Battie remains limited by the flu."
,"Apparently, it's going to take a little time for O'Neal's new medication to kick in.  He's listed as day-to-day."
,"Brown missed Friday's game in order to attend a funeral."
,"Alexander had two points in seven minutes before departing."
,"There's a slight possibility that the real reason Camby missed the game is because he's about to be traded.  The Nuggets are listing him as probable for Tuesday."
,"If the Cavs were trying to win now, Jumaine Jones would have already replaced Miles in the starting lineup.  As is, the Cavs might as well stick with Miles and hopes he begins to put things together over the final third of the season."
,"Like every other player on Atlanta's roster, Terry is available in trade talks.  However, it doesn't appear that the team is close to making a deal."
,""
,"Miller played four minutes before getting tossed, scoring one point."
,""
,"Michael Jordan would have been playing on his 40th birthday tomorrow.  The rescheduling will give the Wizards a stretch of four games in five nights over the first five days of March."
,"Garnett also had six assists and five blocks.  He's averaging 27.5 points, 14.5 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game this month."
,"Jamison returned after getting hurt, but he was only able to play four minutes in the fourth quarter.  He finished with six points."
,"The Grizzlies had eight players attempt between seven and nine shots and all but Michael Dickerson made at least half his attempts.  Gasol was 7-of-9 from the field and 5-of-6 from the line.  He also added 11 boards."
,"Despite the return of Kemp, Andrew DeClercq remained Orlando's starting center and had nine points and nine rebounds against the Raptors."
,"Iverson had been probable for the game with a sore right foot."
,"Coleman is finally starting to produce like he did last year, so maybe the Sixers won't need another big man after all.  Consider picking up DC if he's available in your league."
,"Martin missed one game due to a sore left knee."
,"Stoudamire isn't happy at the end of the Portland bench, but he's not going to give up money in order to get out of his current situation."
,"Elden Campbell will head back to the bench with Brown back."
,"Jackson has been limited by the injury recently, opening up more playing time for Manu Ginobili."
,"Philadelphia apparently would give up Derrick Coleman in exchange for Foyle and another player.  Coleman is in the final year of his contract, making him attractive to other teams in trade talks.  Foyle has one more year to go after this."
,"''I'm doing bad; I'm hurting,'' O'Neal said. ''I can't play like this. I'm going to have to get back on the medicine. I just hope it don't mess me up on the inside.''  O'Neal doesn't like taking Indocin because it upsets his stomach and causes health concerns regarding its long-term use.  However, if it will get him through the season, it looks like he's willing to take his chances."
,"McKie could miss more than one game.  Kenny Thomas, who replaced McKie in the starting lineup last week, will continue to play big minutes until McKie returns.  Greg Buckner also will get more time."
,"The Sixers aren't listing him on their injury report for the game."
,"Iverson didn't practice yesterday, but he will play today."
,"Radmanovic has come off the bench in two games since returning from a sprained left ankle.  Since he'll replace Reggie Evans as Seattle's starting power forward, he'll again be safe to use in fantasy leagues."
,"Martin doesn't expect to be back at 100 percent again this season, so he might see less minutes than usual, especially now that Rodney Rogers is back."
,"Pierce, who hurt the wrist on Thursday, also had eight rebounds and three steals."
,"Brand also had 12 rebounds and two blocks in his 47 minutes."
,"Sean Rooks, who had been starting at center since Michael Olowokandi went down, didn't play in the game.  No injury was reported, so it was likely a matchup issue which caused him not to play.  With the Celtics using Walter McCarty at center, the Clippers wanted to go small.  Cherokee Parks ended up playing most of the minutes at center and had 14 points."
,"Walter McCarty again started at center for Boston."
,""
,"Don't expect him to keep this up for much longer.  Davis averaged just 7.2 points per game prior to the All-Star break."
,"Drobnjak apparently has reclaimed his starting job for the moment.  Jerome James had been starting at center for Seattle."
,"Barry isn't 100 percent, but it looks like he's getting better.  He should have some fantasy value over the final two months."
,"Nowitzki has yet to have a triple-double in his career, but he's getting closer."
,"Jones could rejoin the Heat and play in Monday's game."
,"Consider Carter day-to-day."
,"Williams played 29 minutes in the game and finished with nine points and three assists."
,"Chandler is blossoming.  He may continue to be inconsistent, but he's well worth owning in all leagues."
,"Camby missed practice yesterday with a virus."
,"Predrag Drobnjak started in his place."
,"Tony Parker is playing well, so don't expect Claxton to have much of a role this season.  He does figure to take away what minutes Steve Kerr was getting."
,"The Spurs apparently are confident that David Robinson will return soon.  Otherwise, they would have activated Speedy Claxton in Robinson's place."
,"Funderburke missed 10 games with two foot injuries."
,"Cleaves is averaging 1.3 points in 12 games this season."
,"Murray was originally expected back in March, but there's no longer any timetable for his return.  He could miss the entire season."
,"Claxton would have been activated yesterday had the Spurs been certain that Robinson would need to miss the full five games after he was placed on the injured list.  If the Spurs think that Robinson will be ready to play next week, they'll probably activate Claxton and place Mengke Bateer on the injured list."
,"Palacio is expected to return for the Cavaliers' game tomorrow against the Pistons."
,"Drew goes on the injured list for the third time this season.  It's been a lost year for him."
,"Haston has played in seven games this season, scoring a total of four points."
,"Gentry referred medical questions to athletic trainer Jasen Powell, who said Olowokandi's rehab has been going well, but stressed that he would probably be lost to the team for as long as six weeks.  ''Michael wants to make sure he comes back at 100% and nothing short of that,'' Powell said. ''He is shooting to come back before the end of the season.''"
,"O'Neal has a sore left knee and big right toe, but he intends to keep playing.  ''We're not [worried],'' coach Phil Jackson said. ''We think it's nothing serious.''"
,"If Coleman can't play, Brian Skinner will get most of the minutes at center."
,"Consider McKie probable for tomorrow's game."
,"Iverson, Aaron McKie and Derrick Coleman are all battling injuries for the Sixers right now, but they will probably play tomorrow against the Nets."
,"Coach Larry Brown said that MacCulloch could be finished for the season."
,"Battie missed Thursday's game with the flu and remains limited.  He might not start tonight."
,"''This isn't bad,'' Pierce said of the wrist. ''It was (injured) on the play when Scottie (Pippen) undercut me on the charge (Pierce was called for the offensive foul). I landed on my wrist, and I didn't feel it until later. It's just a light sprain though. It'll be fine - I hope.''"
,"The Knicks want more than just Keith Van Horn in exchange for Sprewell.  GM Scott Layden is currently hoping to pull of a trade with the Grizzlies, getting Pau Gasol in exchange for Kurt Thomas, point guard prospect Milos Vujanic and a draft pick."
,"Lewis probably would have stayed in had the Sonics not been losing big to the Kings.  He's expected to play tonight."
,"It's always something.  Nuggets coach Jeff Bzdelik said he expected Camby to play tonight."
,"An MRI on Stackhouse's strained left groin came back negative.  He'll return to the starting lineup on Monday, displacing Bryon Russell."
,"Martin missed last night's game with a sore knee."
,"Fizer will need 6-8 months of rehab."
,"With the Spurs taking on the Lakers, Willis got the start over Malik Rose, who had seven points and six rebounds off the bench."
,"Bryant finished with 44 points.  He's just the fourth player have to have eight 35-point games in a row.  Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and Michael Jordan are the others."
,"Consider Wallace day-to-day."
,"Jackson, who wore a protective wrap on his left hand, wasn't supposed to play much, but he persuaded coach Adelman to give him 17 minutes.  His minutes should continue to increase each night as long as he is healthy."
,"Christie got nine of his assists in the first quarter and hit 4-of-6 shots Friday night, helping the Kings to a blowout win over the Sonics."
,"Clark got the start at power forward in place of injured Chris Webber.  If Clark could start for someone, these would be normal numbers for him."
,""
,"Shawn Bradley got the majority of the minutes at center and had 12 points, 10 boards and five blocks."
,"Dickerson was 2-of-4 from the field and 1-of-2 from beyond the arc.  With Dickerson joining the rotation, Gordan Giricek was a DNP-CD against the Mavericks."
,"Andrew DeClecq again started in his place.  Kemp is expected to play on Sunday."
,"Campbell outperformed Jamaal Magloire tonight, but that doesn't mean he's close to getting his starting job back for good."
,""
,"Laettner had 17 points and 14 boards last night.  He is hard to figure out and is certainly too inconsistent to be counted on at this point.  If Karl Malone would have gone to Duke, Laettner's line would probably been much better, since he seems to save all of his good nights for games against Duke Alumni."
,"Coleman, hounded by numerous trade rumors, played his best game of the year and shot 9-of-14 from the floor."
,"T-Mac continues to post awesome numbers, helping support the argument from many supporters that he is the best player in the league."
,"Miller was 13-of-21 from the floor and hit five threes as well.  He had been in a funk, averaging just 11 points a game in his last four."
,"Okur has been putting up some impressive numbers lately, although he's not very consistent.  Ben Wallace had just three points and eight boards against the Bucks, and Okur picked up the slack.  He's probably not worth picking up yet, but his story is intriguing and he should be watched closely."
,"Mobley is in the midst of a serious slump, shooting a combined 8-of-33 (24%) over his last three games.  Mobley was playing great up until the slump started, so he should be able to shake it off soon."
,"Yao did not have any blocks tonight either.  While it shouldn't be considered a bad game, his owners have come to expect better."
,"Williams, who has also been bothered by a sore foot, scored 15 points, had six assists and hit three treys tonight."
,"When Baron Davis went down it was initially believed that Courtney Alexander and Robert Pack would benefit the most.  However, Lynch has been putting up much better numbers than either of them and continues to start for the Hornets.  He should be available in most leagues, and while he doesn't score a lot, he is averaging eight points, 4.5 assists and seven boards a game in his last five contests."
,"Reggie hit 7-of-10 from downtown, shooting 9-of-21 overall from the floor. Ironically, he hit only 1-of-3 freethrows. This was the first time in his last seven games he has broken the 20 point plateau."
,"He scored 13 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, which seems to be the quarter that he normally turns it on.  However, he is too inconsistent to have any value right now, and he failed to record a single assist in 23 minutes tonight."
,"Not only did he have nine blocks but he just missed a triple-double by scoring 16 points and grabbing 14 boards.  The points and boards were an added bonus as he had only been averaging just over seven of each for the month of February.  He is averaging 6.5 blocks per game for this month as well."
,"Martin hurt the knee last week in the Nets' final game before the All-Star break. He played on both Tuesday and Wednesday, but did not practice Thursday after telling coach Byron Scott that his knee was a little sore. Brian Scalabrine started in his place."
,"Radmanovic probably won't get his starting job back immediately.  Hold off on activating him for now."
,"Anderson's injury should result in more minutes for Brent Barry and Desmond Mason."
,"Rogers has been a disappointment since joining the Nets.  He should play better over the next couple of months, but he's not going to have any fantasy value."
,"Armstrong is New Jersey's fourth-string point guard, so he might just spend the rest of the year on the injured list."
,"Robinson hasn't been replaced on the active roster, so he can be activated at any time.  However, he's likely to miss at least two more games.  Malik Rose will have some value until Robinson returns."
,"Jackson missed 21 games with a broken left hand.  He'll return as a backup for both Mike Bibby and Doug Christie.  Wait for him to start putting up numbers before you consider picking him up and activating him."
,"Pollard, out since Jan. 29, is expected to miss another 3-5 weeks."
,"Kemp's indefinite suspension lasted just three days.  He should get his starting job back, but he's not someone with fantasy value."
,"Parks will help back up Sean Rooks until Michael Olowokandi returns."
,"Even with Michael Olowokandi out, Zhizhi has yet to make much of a contribution with the Clippers.  It says a lot that the team would rather have Cherokee Parks on their active roster."
,"Coach Rick Adelman, however, is known for his slow approach in bringing players back from injury. He waited a week past the point Mike Bibby said he was ready before letting Bibby return."
,"The team has outside shooters with Voshon Lenard, Morris Peterson and Alvin Williams, so if Carter looks to create, draw fouls, kick out, etc., it can only help the team. He can find one of the above on the wing, score himself, or get the ball down low to Antonio Davis or Jerome Williams. If Carter makes this adjustment he'll be less of a 3-point threat, but his shooting percentage and assists would increase."
,"Some have suggested Swift's up-and-down play has been due to the trade rumors being a distraction. He maintains it's been due more to finding a comfort zone in coach Hubie Brown's system."
,"Coach Gregg Popovich said Claxton will be evaluated again today before a decision is made on his status for tonight's game against the Lakers."
,"Williams has only played in four games this season."
,"The Warriors, Knicks, and Magic are the most likely trade partners. One scenario would see Derrick Coleman, under contract through this season for $9.5 million, and another player sent to Golden State for Adonal Foyle and another player. A second scenario has Keith Van Horn going to New York for Sprewell. Still another would see at least one Sixer sent to the Magic for Mike Miller."
,"The backcourt of Billups and Richard Hamilton has been garnering accolades from around the league. Atkins doesn't mind. Billups is a close friend, one he encouraged to join the Pistons. And the team is winning. But Atkins no longer has any fantasy value."
,"Coach Rudy Tomjanovich is following doctors orders, which recommended four tough practices with no negative results before activating Rice."
,"Stackhouse had hoped to play in Friday's game against the Utah Jazz, the last of Washington's three-game Western swing, but decided today he would rather get full clearance from team doctor Steve Haas instead of risking further damage."
,"Pierce, who was listed as doubtful with a strained right groin, sat out most of the second quarter due to foul trouble, but he didn't appear limited by the injury.  He was 13-of-20 shooting and 3-of-7 from long range."
,"Walter McCarty started in Battie's place and had eight points in 31 minutes."
,"Hamilton made 10-of-18 shots and also had 6 rebounds.  Not much else across the box score for "Rip" but you're accustomed to that."
,"Robinson also had 6 rebounds, a steal and a block in 44 minutes."
,"Typical Wallace fashion, he also had 7 points."
,"Vaughn needs more assists to be considered much of a fantasy option.  He collected 2 tonight."
,"McGrady only made 13-of-31 shots, but his owners won't complain."
,"DeClercq will continue to get the starting nod with Shawn Kemp out of the lineup, but he'll have very little fantasy value."
,"Pierce had been listed as doubtful with a strained right groin."
,"The Magic are hoping to get Kemp back soon.  ``We're getting conflicting reports about whether he will have to take another test on Friday,'' coach Doc Rivers said today. ``The bottom line is, we don't know. We don't know what's going on. They just told us it takes longer than you think to process all of the stuff. We just have to be patient. At the end of the day, if he's proven innocent then it was worth it.''"
,"Jones, day-to-day with a strained left groin, could return on Monday.  In the meantime, Rasual Butler likely will start in his place."
,"Team officials said Brown will skip the game to attend the funeral of a relative of his wife.  He is expected to return for Sunday's home game against Denver.  Jerome Moiso and Elden Campbell will help fill in for Brown tomorrow."
,"Jones says he has been playing with the injury for some time, and aggravated it Tuesday. He's not sure he'll be on the team flight later today. ''I'm going to give it two days of rest and a lot of treatment and see what happens. If it comes to me not traveling, maybe I'll meet them in Dallas [on Saturday],'' he said."
,"Battie missed a game to attend to personal matters."
,"''We'll evaluate him, but it's highly unlikely that he'll play,'' coach Jim O'Brien said. O'Brien hasn't decided who would start in Pierce's place. Tony Delk, Kedrick Brown, and Walter McCarty are all possibilities."
,"He is expected to participate in a workout today, and depending on his performance, could be activated."
,"Anderson didn't practice yesterday and is listed as questionable for tomorrow's game."
,"Coach Byron Scott said Rogers' return would have a lot to do with how he practices today."
,"He posted eight points, four rebounds, and eight assists."
,"Camby said he expects to play about 15 minutes per game while his ankle continues to heal. The latest trade rumor involving Camby has him headed to the Lakers for Robert Horry and Samaki Walker."
,"Laettner also held fellow former-Dukie Elton Brand to 15 points and four rebounds. If last night was a clue, the Wizards and coach Doug Collins are going to rely on their veterans like Laettner down the stretch towards the playoffs."
,"Lue, who claimed the starting job at point guard on Tuesday, got far more playing time than Larry Hughes, who scored 13 points in 22 minutes.  Lue will need to show some consistency before he'll be worth picking up in fantasy leagues."
,"Malone left the game with 30.9 seconds left in the second quarter after taking an elbow to the face from teammate John Amaechi. The accidental hit got Malone's nose bleeding again. Malone returned, but had just five points in the second half."
,"It's unlikely that Thomas will continue to start at center, but the shift worked against Dallas, as the Bucks pulled off the upset.  Michael Redd replaced Thomas at small forward and finished with seven points."
,""
,"Camby missed all five of his shot attempts, but he did have six rebounds."
,"Whitney should have a little fantasy value while starting, but don't expect big things."
,"O'Neal sat out most of the first quarter with the injury.  He played a total of 30 minutes in the win over New Orleans."
,"Swift had missed eight of the previous nine games with a hand injury."
,"The three-man shooting guard rotation didn't develop against the Nets, as Michael Dickerson didn't play.  Person did get more minutes than starter Gordan Giricek, who scored eight points."
,"Houston had six assists and three treys."
,"He also added five rebounds, but at this point he has little fantasy value."
,"Bryant had 42 against the Nuggets on Tuesday.  He scored all 51 points before the third quarter ended.  He left the game with over three minutes left in the third and shot 15-of-28 from the floor.  He only had three boards and two assists, but he obviously wasn't doing a lot of passing tonight."
,"McCoy missed two games after getting hurt on Jan. 31."
,"Jefferies had missed the last month with a lower back problem."
,"Jelani McCoy got extra minutes in Bradley's place."
,"He also connected five times from three point land, and showed no problems with his sore ankles."
,"Rose will be re-evaluated Thursday.  If he's going to miss a game or two, Trenton Hassell would get his starting job back."
,"Kenny Thomas started over McKie tonight.  If it's a permanent switch, McKie isn't going to be worth using in fantasy leagues.  Thomas, however, would be a decent option.  He had 17 points and 10 rebounds tonight."
,"He shot 13-of-23 from the floor but missed all of his three-point attempts. He has had at least one three in all but two of his last 14 games."
,"Snow also had four steals and six rebounds tonight."
,"Marshall's injury apparently isn't going to have any impact on his production."
,"Nash has been on a hot streak as of late. He plays at 100 miles per hour and you have to wonder how long his body can take it. His owners should enjoy the roll he is on for as long as he can keep it up."
,"Stockton just missed a triple-double in his last two games, but Matt Harpring stole most of his assists tonight, finishing with 10."
,"The 10 assists is a seaon high, but he only shot 4-of-15 from the field."
,"Jason Williams was out with the flu and should be back for Memphis' next game.  Watson has been very solid when Williams has been out and could steal some of his minutes away."
,"Earl Watson again started in Williams' place and had his best game as a pro with 21 points, eight boards, six assists and four steals.  Watson filled in for Williams when he missed their last game due to a sore left foot. Watson played solidly in both games.  While Williams should be back for the next game, Watson could push him for minutes."
,"Speculation is that it wasn't just his shooting that put him on the bench, as trade rumors involving Sprewell are prevalent right now.  As the Knicks start a six-game West Coast swing, Sprewell may have played his last game as a Knick."
,"Baxter had missed the last five games with tendinitis in his left knee."
,"Chandler hit 8-of-9 from the floor and was unstoppable tonight. He has been having games like this every few weeks, but based on his performance in the second half of last season, there's a decent chance he will put up respectable numbers the rest of the way."
,"Jalen has been on fire, averaging 27 points a game in his last five. He also connected four times from behind the arc, hit all six free throw attempts and was 14-of-25 from the floor."
,"True to his word, coach Lenny Wilkens lifted the 30-minute restriction on Carter and played him for 37 minutes tonight.  Carter appears to be getting closer to his old form, while Morris Peterson and Voshon Lenard's numbers continue to suffer due to Carter's return."
,"Consider him day-to-day."
,"Davis shot 9-of-20 from the floor.  Had just one of those misses fallen, he would have shot 50% from the floor for the first time since December 20th when he went 13-for-25.  Instead, the streak continues."
,"KG also shot 10-of-17 from the floor and 6-of-7 from the line as he continues on the roll that started a couple games before the All-Star break.  He now has a league leading 41 double-doubles."
,"``We're going to shut Todd down and try to find real definitive answers,'' coach Larry Brown said before Wednesday night's game against the Bulls.  The Sixers will continue to use Brian Skinner and Derrick Coleman at center."
,"Strickland likely will be out until very late Feb. or early March."
,"Wilks, who spent 20 days with the Hawks last month, will help back up Troy Hudson for the Wolves.  Igor Rakocevic should go back to being the team's No. 3 point guard."
,"Dickerson will battle Wesley Person and Gordan Giricek for minutes at shooting guard.  It's hard to imagine that any of the three will have much fantasy value."
,"Earl Watson will continue to back up Jason Williams in place of Knight."
,"Baxter will try to help replace Marcus Fizer for the Bulls, but don't expect him to have any fantasy value."
,"Bagaric is on the injured list for the fourth time this season."
,"Tskitishvili said he was pulled over Monday en route to Denver International Airport because he had expired license plates on his truck.  He's also had some other violations, so he was taken to a police station and held for nearly five hours.  Tskitishvili did play last night, scoring four points in 16 minutes."
,"Monday's game against the Raptors is looking like the earliest Stackhouse will play."
,"Radmanovic did however work out before the game with strength and conditioning coach Dwight Daub and is hopeful of coming off the IL Friday."
,"The Spurs believe the hip and knee injuries are effects of the back injury Robinson first suffered three weeks ago. Malik Rose will start and Kevin Willis will see plenty of minutes while Robinson is out."
,"Davis got stuck in Atlanta over the All-Star break on personal business and was fined an undisclosed amount by the Blazers."
