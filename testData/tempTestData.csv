,"Dante Exum scored 10 points: George Hill (groin) missed his second straight game and Exum had nowhere to go but up after going scoreless on 0-of-6 FGs Wednesday. He did a great job on John Wall and could be looking at another start on Sunday vs. the Spurs, but that's a tough matchup and Shelvin Mack still looks like a better DFS option -- Mack had 15 points in 26 minutes."
,"Russell Westbrook scores 32 in triple-double: After OKC had its biggest comeback win since playing in Oklahoma on Wednesday, they blew a 21-point lead for this home loss. A big reason for the loss was because of how the Spurs defended Westbrook. 'They were bringing the whole team,' Westbrook said about the defense. 'That's what they do. I've just got to try to make the right play.' This game makes it five consecutive triple-doubles and nine in his last 11 to get him up to 39 on the season, trailing Oscar Robertson by just two for most in a season. That record is as good as gone."
,"Markieff Morris tweaks ankle in loss: He appeared to roll his ankle and was forced to leave the game, but he was walking under his own power and later checked back in. Morris hit all four of his free throws and added seven rebounds, but he's been very underwhelming for weeks. Prior to Friday, he was averaging just 10.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.5 blocks and 0.5 triples in March. Morris and Marcin Gortat have slowed down at the worst possible time for fantasy owners."
,"Domantas Sabonis scores nine: Taj Gibson (illness) did not play and was a game-time decision. Chances are Gibson should be back for Sunday, so Sabonis will be going right back to the bench. He also picked up a DNP-CD on Monday."
,"Mike Conley scores 28 points vs. Mavs: The Grizzlies have clinched their seventh consecutive trip to the postseason, which is the third-longest active streak in the NBA. They've done it slightly differently this year with a franchise record in 3-pointers and slightly more pace. Those two factors have been a big reason why Conley has been a second-round player in standard leagues per game this season. He actually doesn't get a noteworthy usage bump when Marc Gasol (foot) is out, but Conley is on fire without his big man."
,"Bradley Beal drops 27 points in loss: The Cavaliers, Celtics and Raptors all won tonight, meaning the Wizards are now tied with Toronto, 2.5 games behind the Cavs and 3.0 games behind Boston. Beal hit 10-of-20 shots with three boards, two steals and three triples, and after hitting five triples in his previous outing vs. the Clippers, he set the franchise record for most 3-pointers in a season, passing Gilbert Arenas (205)."
,"Zach Randolph scores 22 with 12 boards: That's his 19th double-double of the season with 18 of those coming off the bench. Coach David Fizdale has talked about needing some help in his second unit at times this year, so that explains why Z-Bo is sticking in the second unit sans Marc Gasol (foot). As long as Z-Bo doesn't rest, he should have some big games until Gasol gets back."
,"Troy Daniels hits seven treys: It was money green time for the Daniels in the second unit with Daniels' 12 attempts from deep accounting for all the non-starting Grizzlies tries from beyond the arc. He hasn't shot the ball well this month at just 30.7 percent from the field in his previous March games, so there's no need to overreact to this stat line. If the Grizzlies do rest guys, he'll be an option."
,"James Ennis has solid game again: That's two decent games as the starter with a 10-point, seven-board game coming on Wednesday. The Grizzlies may give him some extra run now that they've clinched their postseason spot, but Ennis' upside isn't the greatest until this situation becomes more concrete."
,"Brandan Wright scores eight points: Not quite a revenge game for Wright, but he gave the Grizzlies some good minutes and should see playing time until Marc Gasol (foot) can return. With the Grizzlies clinching a playoff spot tonight, they may just take it easy on Gasol. Wright could be a streaming option."
,"Mejri scores eight: His playing time has dropped since Nerlens Noel arrived, but Mejri is still ahead of Dwight Powell. If there is a lot of rest, maybe we see a couple noteworthy Mejri games. Leave him on the wire."
,"Greg Monroe held to three points: Monroe was simply a spectator on the bench with Thon Maker going bonkers with 23 points and four triples. Moose hasn't seen a bump in minutes with John Henson (thumb) out, but as long as he keeps getting his usual 22-26 minutes off the bench, he will still help most fantasy owners. Expect him to get back on track vs. the Mavericks on Sunday."
,"Yogi Ferrell scores three points: Seth Curry (shoulder) aggravated his injury and the Mavs are expected to rest some players next week, so things could be looking up for Ferrell. Still, he's not playing well enough to add in standard leagues or until Curry is officially ruled out."
,"Nerlens Noel scores 10 points: It's tough to gauge what the plan is for Noel going forward. On the one hand, the Mavs want to experiment with him at center, but on the other there is talk of rest next week. Noel's fantasy owners should just keep him going until further notice."
,"Khris Middleton scores 25 w/ 10 rebounds: After scoring 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting in his previous outing, it's safe to say that his slump is officially over. This was his first double-double of the campaign and he tied his season-high with four 3-pointers. With the Bucks fighting for playoff seeding, Middleton is locked in the rest of the way."
,"Matthew Dellavedova plays 35 minutes in start: The minutes were nice, but he only shot 2-of-8 from the field. Delly wasn't worth owning as a full-time starter earlier this season, and unless Malcolm Brogdon (back) misses Sunday's game vs. Dallas, most fantasy owners should look elsewhere."
,"Wes Matthews has strong game: His extremely patient fantasy owners can be happy here, but there's going to be some rest coming for Matthews on Wednesday or Tuesday. Now that the Mavs are essentially out of the playoffs, Matthews' downside outweighs his upside in fantasy."
,"Dirk scores 13 points vs. Grizzlies: He is likely going to rest on either Tuesday or Wednesday, so we'll likely see Nowitzki sit some games out going forward. Upcoming rest aside, it's almost shocking Dirk has been so durable after a injury-plagued start to his season. His fantasy owners should expect him to have a drop off with some rest going forward."
,"Harry B looking like Warriors Harry B: He's had a rough month and all his isolation plays have come back to bite him. Coach Rick Carlisle said there could be rest coming for the veterans, so Barnes' fantasy owners will have to see if he's included in that group. Considering he isn't playing well, it's not crazy to drop him."
,"Giannis scores 28 w/ 14 boards, nine dimes: With the win, the Bucks are currently the No. 5 seed with a 0.5 game lead over the Hawks. Giannis hit 7-of-16 shots and added a pair of blocks with one steal, but really struggled at the free throw line (14-of-21FTs). He was hitting his free throws at a 77.5 percent clip prior to Friday, so this isn't anything to panic about. He looks like he's going to be a top-3 asset in fantasy leagues for a very long time."
,"Boogie's Revenge: Cousins scores 37 vs. Kings: That stat line may even make Jusuf Nurkic jealous. Cousins is just the fifth player in NBA history to post at least 35 points and 10 boards in his first game against his former team. He also reportedly hosted the Kings minority owners in a box for his first game against them, and he was wearing a 'Loyalty' outfit in a press conference when talking about this matchup. Cousins also said it was weird to go against the Kings and he said he looked over at coach Dave Joerger because he was used to it. Score another one for the Revenge Game narrative."
,"Anthony Davis scores 19 with five blocks: While DeMarcus Cousins gets all the hoopla here, Davis was just awesome on both ends. His five blocks are also the most he's had since Boogie joined the Pelicans, and it's well above his 1.4 blocks per game since Cousins joined him. Davis hasn't missed a single game since the break and he's been a top-five player in fantasy over that span."
,"Maker's Mark: Thon scores career-high 23 pts: Giannis Antetokounmpo told Maker that he would punch him if he hesitated before a shot, so the rookie responded with his best game of the season. He finished 9-of-12 from the field and 4-of-7 from deep with two rebounds and a steal, and he played down the stretch at the expense of Greg Monroe -- he even scored five of Milwaukee's 13 points in overtime. Maker needs to add some muscle and has been bullied a bit in the paint, so that's why he was averaging 10.0 minutes in his previous 10 outings. The future is bright for the 20-year-old rookie, but he will need another strong game before we could get behind a pickup in deeper leagues."
,"Buddy Hield scores 13 points vs. Pelicans: His former home crowd gave him a nice ovation in his first game back. Hield also had a solid first half with nine points, but was quiet after the break. The Kings have made it clear they want to get Hield going and he's been solid in his last seven, averaging 15.0 points, 5.4 boards, 2.9 assists, 1.0 steals and 2.0 treys. He's been a sixth-round player in that span, so he's shaping up to be a mid-round guy the rest of the way."
,"Willie Cauley-Stein double-doubles: That's surprisingly his first double-double since Mar. 15, but he's able to turn in some output in both categories since then. Cauley-Stein also is in a slump with blocks, totaling just one in his last five games combined. He's still been solid in percentages and steals, so he remains a must-start player in standard leagues."
,"Ish Smith scores 16 w/ five assists: The Pistons have lost nine out of their last 11 games, but coach Stan Van Gundy praised Smith for 'playing unencumbered every night.' SVG added that Smith's 'spirit is right,' and it looks like he's going to be the starter the rest of the way -- SVG still hasn't decided if Reggie Jackson (knee) will play again this season. If you own Smith, just keep in mind that the Pistons don't play again until Apr. 5."
,"Skal Labissiere scores 13 points: He was in a brutal slump due to fouling and missing shots, so this was a welcomed sight. Although, Labissiere was still just 5-of-16 from the field and 3-of-6 from the line in this loss. With the Kings going heavier on rest lately, Labissiere figures to get minutes in the 30s and offer decent upside most nights. He's worth a look in standard leagues, but he's likely going to be inconsistent."
,"Papa G gets a heavy dose of Boogie: He had to guard DeMarcus Cousins a lot in this game, and you can imagine how that went. The Kings rested Kosta Koufos in consecutive games for the first time this year, so maybe Papagiannis continues to see minutes in the low 20s. He's a possible streaming guy or worth a look for big-needy owners."
,"Isaiah Thomas scores 35 points vs. Magic: The Celtics keep their 0.5 game lead over the Cavs and have a magic number of seven to clinch home-court advantage. Boston is 28-10 at home compared to 21-17 on the road, so clearly they want to play as many games at TD Garden as possible -- the Cavs are just 19-19 on the road, too. As for Thomas, it's been business as usual with four consecutive 30-plus scoring games. IT is also just 0.1 points per game behind James Harden for No. 2 in the NBA."
,"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scores 17 points: This game went into overtime and KCP logged 38 minutes, racking up eight rebounds, two assists, two steals and two triples. KCP was arrested early Wednesday morning on suspicion of driving while intoxicated and reportedly registered a blood alcohol content of 0.08. The Pistons and the NBA are still gathering all the details, and while it's not a lock, a suspension could be coming."
,"Tobias Harris bounces back w/ 23 points: Not a bad way to respond after he was held to eight points in his previous outing. Harris shot 10-of-14 from the field and hit his only free throw of the night, and despite coming off the bench, he's still seeing more than enough minutes to return mid-round value for his owners. If your fantasy league ends this weekend, just keep in mind that the Pistons are now off until Apr. 5."
,"Jae Crowder scores 18 points vs. ORL: He moved up a notch in the offense and was able to knock down 6-of-11 from the field in this win. Crowder does only get a 0.5 usage rate when Avery Bradley is off the court, but he's actually more efficient. Crowder is going to put up great stats regardless, so keep him rolling."
,"Jaylen Brown gets another start: He should be looking at another start on Sunday because Bradley is doubtful. Still, Brown is going to need to get hot, rack up the defensive stats, or pick up garbage-time stats to have value in most leagues."
,"Marcus Smart struggles as a shooter again: He made his first shot from the field, and that was it. Smart has been a disaster from deep since the break, making just 18.5 percent on a whopping 4.3 attempts per game. Coach Brad Stevens said he still has confidence in Smart as a shooter, so maybe that should hurt his Coach of the Year chances. Bad shooting aside, Smart should have a big chance to fill the stat sheet on Sunday with Avery Bradley (illness) doubtful."
,"Josh Richardson held to two points: Welp. Richardson is a lot like Danny Green and can bury his fantasy owners with his field goal percentage, but he stays relevant because of his blocks, steals and triples. While he didn't have any 3-pointers this time around, he added five assists, two blocks, one rebound and one steal in 29 minutes. He averaged 12.2 points, 2.2 boards, 3.0 assists, 1.4 blocks, 1.6 steals and 1.6 treys in his previous five games, but he's obviously a volatile option on a nightly basis."
,"Elfrid Payton scores 12 with 15 dimes: The Magic almost had this win as Elf missed a layup with just two seconds left. Payton's assists have been on the rise with 8.0 per game over his previous three, and clearly the Magic want him to get as much run as possible as they head into the offseason. With the 2017 draft having so many point guards up top, the Magic want to see what they have in Payton. They're sitting in the No. 4 spot in the lottery with the 76ers just 1.0 games 'behind' them."
,"Vooch doesn't do much vs. Celtics: It's just a bad game for Vooch, but he hasn't played particularly well lately on the offensive end. The Magic have not said anything about resting him, so his fantasy owners can throw him out there unless there's a change in how the Magic feel about the lottery."
,"Aaron Gordon erupts for 32 points, 16 boards: His 32 points are just one off his career high, as well. Obviously Gordon's sore shoulder was not a problem despite being called a game-time decision. As has been the case for the past month, the move to power forward has been huge for Gordon, making 49.5 percent from the field since the break compared to just 42.8 percent before that. This monster game moved him up to sixth-round value since the break, so his strong finish will create some buzz when 2017 draft season comes around."
,"Hassan Whiteside scores 17 points in loss: He was invisible in the first half with four points and four rebounds, but looked much better after the break. Whiteside is still a little banged up and is playing though some pain in his shooting hand which explains why his shot attempts are down. He finished 6-of-9 from the field and 5-of-7 from the line, and with the Heat sitting just 0.5 games over the Bulls (No. 9 seed), Whiteside's owners wont have to worry about him taking any time off."
,"Terrence Ross scores 17 points: Those threes and making all three free throw attempts gave him some respectable efficiency. Ross is kind of on a roll over his last five, averaging 18.8 points, 2.4 boards, 1.2 assists, 2.0 steals, 0.6 blocks and 3.4 treys on 52.9 percent from the field. He's too hot to not start right now in almost any fantasy league."
,"Kristaps Porzingis scores 22 points in win: That's three straight games with 20+ points and he's going to keep eating with Derrick Rose (knee) and Carmelo Anthony (knee) looking at more DNPs down the stretch. Porzingis hit 10-of-18 shots with seven rebounds, three assists, one block and three triples, and as long as he's healthy, his owners can keep rolling him out there with confidence."
,"Amir Johnson says ankle is sore: Ankle injuries and Amir Johnson don't exactly get along and the Celtics likely wouldn't want to play him at less than 100 percent. Johnson finished with five points, five boards, three assists, one steal, two blocks and one 3-pointer -- he actually tweaked his ankle on the trey. If he can't go, expect more Kelly Olynyk, Jonas Jerebko and small-ball lineups."
,"LeBron James scores 34 points in win vs. PHI: While beating a banged-up 76ers team is hardly anything to write home about, the Cavs needed this one. Their defense still wasn't very good overall and this game wouldn't have been such a blowout if the 76ers weren't so sloppy with the basketball all the time. Whatever the case, LeBron has been vocal about not wanting to rest too much, and the Cavs not playing their best ball right now makes for a strong argument."
,"Kyrie Irving scores 24 points vs. 76ers: Somewhat surprisingly, Irving actually hasn't dominated the 76ers with 23.5 points per game on only 38.6 percent from the field in his previous two games against them. The Cavs don't really have an easy schedule with some solid defenses the rest of the way, but there are some teams with vulnerable point guard D. Obviously next week's game against Boston will be huge for Kyrie."
,"Courtney Lee scores 20 points vs. Heat: When you're starting next to Ron Baker and Sasha Vujacic, you are usually going to have the green light. Lee logged 35 minutes with Carmelo Anthony (knee) and Derrick Rose (knee) watching from the sidelines, hitting all six of his free throws with four rebounds, one assist, three steals and two triples. As good as Lee has been since the break, he could be rested on any given night with the Knicks in tank mode."
,"Ron Baker scores 10 points w/ six assists: The Knicks are going to take their sweet time with Derrick Rose (sore left knee) and Chasson Randle isn't getting much burn, so it looks like Baker could be getting the bulk of the PG minutes going forward. His upside is low and he finished 2-of-12 from the field for six points, five rebounds, three assists and three turnovers in 40 minutes in his previous start, so you would have to be in a very deep league to take a flier on the rookie PG."
,"Kevin Love scores 18 with 10 boards: That's better. After fouling out and looking lost on Thursday, Love didn't have as many lapses in this game. The Cavs not playing well should make it more likely they do not rest players, and also Love has been cleared for back-to-backs for a week. Keep rolling him out there and hope for the best."
,"Richaun Holmes scores 19 points: With Jahlil Okafor (knee) out for the season, the runway is clear for Holmes to get big minutes the rest of the way -- not that there was any doubt for about two weeks. He also gets a 2.6 usage rate bump without Robert Covington (knee), so Holmes should be more involved in the offense. He could flirt with early-round value in the final month of the season."
,"Mindaugas Kuzminskas picks up a DNP-CD: There's no report of an injury and it's a huge surprise to see Kuzminskas not play at all with Carmelo Anthony (knee) inactive. The Knicks inexplicably gave Sasha Vujacic 36 minutes, so deep-league owners can move on from the rookie forward if they haven't already."
,"Sasha Vujacic scores nine points: The Knicks don't always tank games, but when they do, they deploy Sasha Vujacic. The Knicks rested their studs tonight and may continue to do so, but Vujacic isn't a fantasy pickup."
,"Justin Anderson scores 12 with 10 boards: He'll be getting some serious burn the rest of the way with Robert Covington (knee) out for the season. Coach Brett Brown also said he wants to add a power forward, so Anderson should remain as the starter and isn't likely to be pushed for minutes. He should be owned in standard leagues."
,"Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot scores 19 points: Coach Brett Brown has been talking up TLC a lot and he apparently thinks he's no scrub. Luwawu-Cabarrot looks like he's going to get some heavy run with Robert Covington (knee) out for the season. He is a bit hit or miss and it's almost hard to believe his career highs are one block and one steal, so he's not exactly adept in defensive stats. He's more of a 14-team guy, but at least you know he's going to play big minutes and not get rest."
,"Jamal Murray plays 29 minutes in loss: Jameer Nelson left the game with a right calf strain and didn't return, so Murray is the next man up in Denver. He finished just 3-of-9 from the field, but with the Nuggets falling 2.0 games behind the Blazers in their hunt for the No. 8 seed, they may be tempted to give their promising rookie more burn down the stretch. Murray is worth putting on your watch list while we wait for an update on Nelson."
,"T.J. McConnell scores 10 points: He did hurt his left hand in the second half, but he did return to the game. McConnell should continue to get minutes in the 30s with Sergio Rodriguez (hamstring) out for at least a couple more. Garbage time hurt him a bit late in this game."
,"DeMar DeRozan scores 40 points vs. Pacers: He has Vince Carter's single-season franchise record with his 30th 30-point game of the season. The Raptors are playing some terrific defense and their interior presence has helped them add a new wrinkle on both ends. With Kyle Lowry set to make it back in early April, the Raptors could be dangerous in the postseason."
,"Chandler plays 20 minutes off the bench: Will Barton (foot) was out, so the Nuggets moved Chandler to the bench to bolster the second unit. He finished just 2-of-8 from the field with one rebound, one assist and one triple, but with Kenneth Faried (18 points, 13 rebounds) playing out of his mind, coach Michael Malone stuck with the Manimal tonight. Chandler will look to bounce back on Sunday vs. the Heat, but his fantasy owners may be tempted to look elsewhere if he comes off the bench again."
,"Harden, Bev, Gordon, Ariza & Capela starting: The Rockets have been one of the league's best teams on back-to-back sets, so we'll see how they fare today. Harden has also been a monster on a back-to-back set, and we'll be watching his wrist tonight."
,"Nikola Jokic triple-doubles in loss to CHA: That's six triple-doubles for Jokic this season which is the most by a center since the merger. He finished 11-of-16 from the field and 2-of-3 from the line with two triples in 37 minutes, but his team is now sitting 2.0 games behind the Blazers for the No. 8 seed in the West. Jokic will try to get the Nuggets back on track vs. the Heat on Sunday."
,"Kevon Looney out for Friday night: He's not in the rotation anyway, but maybe he can get healthy and play when the Warriors rest guys next month."
,"Update: Matt Barnes will start Friday: Patrick McCaw was going to draw the start, but he's a late scratch due to leg cramps. This still doesn't change the fact that Barnes is only an option in very deep fantasy leagues."
,"Pat McCaw (leg cramps) ruled out for Friday: Apparently, he cramped up in warmups and the team will hold him out. Matt Barnes, Ian Clark and Andre Iguodala should get some extra run."
,"Jonas Valanciunas scores 16 with 17 boards: It was a good day for JV.  On top his his franchise-record 13 rebounds in the third, coach Dwane Casey said he is going to tighten the rotation, which should be a great sign for Valanciunas' playing time. He's lost a lot of fourth-quarter minutes and even guys like Jakob Poeltl have taken run from him. JV has been annoying to own since Serge Ibaka arrived, but maybe he can have a strong finish. He should be worth owning going forward."
,"Kenneth Faried double-doubles w/ 18 and 13: This likely wasn't a matchup move, as the Nuggets moved Wilson Chandler to the second unit to fill the void left by Will Barton (foot). Faried finished 9-of-17 from the field in 32 minutes with two assists, one steal and one block, and we all know that he will only benefit the more he plays next to Nikola Jokic. If he sticks in the first unit, give him a look if you need rebounds."
,"Jakob Poeltl doesn't score in 14 minutes: With coach Dwane Casey saying the Raptors will tighten the rotation, Poeltl should be losing some minutes."
,"Gary Harris plays 41 minutes in loss: He probably has more massive workloads coming his way, as Will Barton missed this game with foot soreness and Jameer Nelson picked up a right calf strain. Harris finished 8-of-14 from the field with five rebounds, three assists and three triples, and if your fantasy league extends beyond this week, his owners can look forward to deploying him four times next week."
,"Serge Ibaka comes up with a double-double: That's his first double-double in March and the Raptors just smashed on the offensive glass in this game. Ibaka also turned in his first multiple-block game since Mar. 19, which was also against the Pacers. He should be a mid-round guy the rest of the way."
,"Plumlee (abdominal contusion) plays 12 mins: He picked up three quick fouls in the first half, so the injury wasn't the reason for the low minutes. His playing time is trending down anyways and he averaged just 17.2 minutes per game over Denver's last three games. He's an obvious drop candidate with the Nuggets playing more small ball."
,"Seth Curry aggravates left shoulder injury: It didn't look good. Curry was driving past Mike Conley and some contact caused him to be in a lot of pain. Curry was on the bench in pain for about two minutes, and then went to the locker room. Considering how much pain he was in, Curry is probably done for the night, and possibly beyond. Yogi Ferrell, J.J. Barea and Devin Harris will benefit."
,"Marvin Williams blocks three shots in win: He was clutch on defense with all three of his blocks coming in the fourth quarter. He finished 3-of-7 from the field and took a backseat on offense with Kemba Walker and Frank Kaminsky feeling it, but Williams still came through for his owners with a gem of a line. He's been a top-30 player over the past couple months in standard leagues and his value is safe with the Hornets chasing the No. 8 seed. They only have three games next week, though."
,"Paul George scores 28 points vs. TOR: A bad 34-20 third quarter cost the Pacers in this game, and now they're just 0.5 games ahead of a heating-up Bulls team for the eighth seed. George has been more vocal about getting more shots lately, and it's also reflected on the stat sheet. In his last 11 games, George has a 31.4 usage rate in 37 minutes per game, which tops his 28.3 usage rate in 35.8 minutes per game before the break. Expect George to be very busy to close out this season."
,"Frank Kaminsky scores 22 points: Miles Plumlee only played seven minutes, so Kaminsky is still getting the bulk of the backup center and power forward minutes. He added two rebounds, one assist and two blocks, and he also matched his career-high with five 3-pointers. The Hornets only have three games next week, but Frank the Tank is worth deploying in most leagues right now."
,"Jeff Teague scores 19 points: He bounced back from a four-point dud against the Grizzlies and has been above his season scoring average in his six previous games before that. Teague came in with solid March averages before this one, averaging 14.1 points, 4.1 boards, 6.7 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.4 blocks and 1.3 treys. With the Pacers fighting for their playoff lives, he'll get some big minutes down the stretch."
,"C.J. Miles scores 15 points: With Lance Stephenson now in the mix, it'll be interesting to see how coach Nate McMillan splits his wing minutes. Unless Miles is hot early, it's likely he drops below his season average of 23.4 minutes per game going forward. He's a drop candidate."
,"Monta Ellis scores four points: While the steals are nice, he made just 1-of-5 from the field in Wednesday's game and there's a very good chance he loses minutes on Sunday when Lance Stephenson is in the rotation. If you've been counting on Monta in a deeper league, you might want to let him go for someone else."
,"Myles Turner scores nine with four blocks: He hasn't been quite up to his expectations lately, but Turner was just killing it in the first 50 games of the season. In his previous March games, Turner averaged just 10.9 points, 7.3 boards, 1.9 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.0 steals. Thanks to those defensive stats, Turner has still been a top-20 player for total value this season. He should have a big finish with the Pacers in a playoff race and he'll be an early-round target next year, as well."
,"Kemba Walker scores 31 points in win: That's two straight wins for the Hornets, moving them just 1.5 games behind the No. 8 seed (Pacers). Walker finished 9-of-23 from the field in 43 minutes with eight assists, three rebounds, one steal and four triples, and he still has the most 3-pointers in the NBA since the All-Star break. He looks like he's going to finish strong with the Hornets looking to sneak into the postseason."
,"Jusuf Nurkic (fibula) out at least 2 weeks: Oh no. He will be re-evaluated after the two weeks, but Nurkic's regular season is now over. The Blazers do have a 1.5-game lead over the Nuggets for the No. 8 spot, so this injury could affect that as well. Nurkic is first Blazer to average 15-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in his first 20 games since 1978, and there's no denying he's been incredible. With him out, coach Terry Stotts will have to look to Meyers Leonard as his five while there will be some Noah Vonleh in there as well. Leonard is worth a look, but it would help if he was playing better. Nurkic's fantasy owners will have to wait until 2017-18 for the next Nurk Alert."
,"Matt Barnes will come off bench  vs. Rockets: The Warriors choose their starting small forward based on the mathcup and will continue to do so until Kevin Durant (knee) returns. Barnes is just a low-end streaming option in deeper leagues regardless of where he starts the game."
,"Pat McCaw will start, Matt Barnes to bench: McCaw came off the bench against the Spurs, which may have been due to his 0-of-12 from the field in his start against them earlier this year. This is a situation to avoid in fantasy."
,"Jameer Nelson (calf) will not return Friday: He walked off the court under his own power and basically went straight to the locker room. Nelson did have some calf issues earlier in his career, but hasn't had a noteworthy incident since 2014. With Nelson out and possibly missing time, Jamal Murray makes sense as a solid speculative add in standard leagues. The Nuggets will likely get Emmanuel Mudiay in the rotation now. Nelson finished with 12 points, nine assists, one steal and four 3-pointers."
,"Miami Tank Machine: Sasha starts vs. MIA: The Knicks will get The Machine in there as they have their players 'hurt' for today's game. Mindaugas Kuzminskas should still get plenty of minutes off the bench, and he's a better option  than Vujacic."
,"Domantas Sabonis will start at PF on Friday: Minimal fantasy impact here. Sabonis has started 64 games this season and is averaging just 6.0 points and 3.7 rebounds in 21.0 minutes in those starts. He can be left on waivers in standard leagues."
,"Taj Gibson (illness) is out; Sabonis starting: Gibson has been sick for at least two days, so the Thunder will have to go back to their pre-deadline rotation up front. Sabonis was not very good for his time in the starting lineup, so he's not a fantasy option. Jerami Grant should also benefit tonight. We may see more Enes Kanter, who had some success against the Spurs last year."
,"Andrew Harrison will not play: The Grizzlies will go with James Ennis, Troy Daniels and Vince Carter to help soak up some minutes on the wings. Harrison is day-to-day."
,"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope will play Friday: KCP was arrested early Wednesday on suspicion of drunken driving, but the Pistons and the NBA are still gathering all the details.  'I'm not going to comment on it,' Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. 'We're aware of the situation and we'll let things run its course.' His owners can deploy him on Friday, but be on the lookout for a possible suspension next week."
,"Alexis Ajinca out for Friday night: He's not in the rotation right now. Enjoy DeMarcus Cousins revenge night."
,"Reggie Jackson (knee) out again Friday: There's a very good chance he's out for the season. The Pistons can't get out of their own way and their playoff chances are dwindling. With Jackson out, Ish Smith should be looking at minutes in the 30s with Beno Udrih backing him up."
,"Derrick Rose (knee) ruled out Friday vs. Heat: This is the second straight game Rose has missed due to the knee issue. Ron Baker started at point guard on Wednesday and logged a game-high 40 minutes, but wasn't overly productive (six points, five boards and three assists). Chasson Randle played 21 minutes off the bench on Wednesday."
,"Anthony and Rose ruled out Friday vs. Miami: Anthony injured his back on Wednesday in the Knicks victory over the Pistons. Mindaugas Kuzminskas will likely draw another start in place of Anthony. Kuz has started five games this season and is averaging 14.0 points and 4.2 rebounds in 30.4 minutes in those five starts. Kristaps Porzingis will also be asked the shoulder most of the offensive load with Melo and Rose sidelined. 
"
,"Taj Gibson (illness) a game-time call vs. SA: He missed shootaround and also Thursday's practice, so he's been sick for at least two days. If Gibson can't play, Domantas Sabonis would get the start. Jerami Grant would also likely be getting some extra run, but fantasy owners may not want to mess with this situation."
,"Beasley on a 15-minute limit: There should be some minutes available with Malcolm Brogdon (back) out and how the Bucks have so many multi-position players. Still, fantasy owners can't trust Beasley in almost any situation right now."
,"Matt Dellevedova starting for Brogdon (back): In the last two games Brogdon missed this month, Dellavedova only played 26.0 minutes per game, so it's not a total lock he gets heavy run. Rashad Vaughn will get some minutes, but obviously the Bucks have themselves capable ball-handlers in Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Delly isn't the best play today, but give him a look if you're feeling gritty."
,"Wilson Chandler coming off the bench: This move is all about Will Barton (foot) not playing today, so adding Chandler to the second unit as a go-to scorer makes a lot of sense. This move does also tip the hand that Chandler should play some more small forward a bit, so that may not be good news for guys like Jamal Murray on the wing. Start Chandler like you normally would."
,"Kenneth Faried starting; Chandler off bench: It makes sense to add Chander in the second unit because Will Barton (foot) isn't playing today. This shouldn't change the outlook on Faried too much today, assuming he doesn't come out like gangbusters. He doesn't get the best matchup against Marvin Williams or Cody Zeller."
,"Aaron Gordon (shoulder) will play on Friday: Gordon has been considered questionable earlier in the day but is ready to roll on Friday night. Gordon is averaging 14.3 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 1.2 blocks over Orlando's last six games."
,"Jahlil Okafor ruled out for rest of the year: The writing has been on the wall for Okafor all month as his troublesome right knee just couldn't get right. It sounds like it's more precautionary than anything, so hopefully hen can resume a normal offseason program. The 76ers will still likely be entertaining some trades on their big man. Richaun Holmes should be owned in all leagues while Shawn Long is worth a look in deeper formats. <br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> With Okafor and Covington now out for the year, we should see a smaller Sixers rotation start to become more predictable in terms of minutes. We should expect Richaun Holmes - who is still reasonably priced across the industry - to see roughly 30 minutes this evening, which sets him up as one of the premier mid-range plays at PF/C. Shawn Long is the only other big competing with Holmes for much court time."
,"Robert Covington (meniscus) out for season: A slight tear in the meniscus, which is the same injury to end Joel Embiid's year. Covington did have a right MCL sprain back in 2015, so this isn't his first knee issue. The team will likely announce their treatment plan, and surgery could also be an option -- it was for Embiid. With RoCo out, Justin Anderson should get some heavy minutes the rest of the way and is worth a look in standard leagues. Dario Saric, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Nik Stauskas and Shawn Long should all slightly benefit."
,"Jaylen Brown to start on Friday vs. Orlando: Brown has started 18 games this season and is averaging 9.5 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 24.7 minutes in those 18 starts.  Coach Brad Stevens said that there is also a chance Bradley will be unable to play Sunday as well. Brown is worth a look as a plug-and-play in very deep leagues. <br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> Jaylen Brown doesn't pick up much in the way of usage with Bradley off the floor this season, but Isaiah Thomas does see a noticeable uptick in production. Thomas gets a 2.0% bump in usage and considering both Brown and Marcus Smart typically don't eat up many shot attempts, Thomas' ceiling and floor are raised with Bradley out of the lineup."
,"Avery Bradley (sick) out; Jaylen Brown starts: He is also doubtful to play on Sunday at New York. After just getting over a stomach bug last week, Bradley is sick again with only two games since the last incident. It's being called a reoccurrence, so hopefully he won't have to go to the hospital again. With Bradley out, it should be Marcus Smart benefiting the most, assuming he can make a couple shots today. Brown is worth a look as a stream, but would likely need garbage time to have an impact on the stat sheet. Bradley's owners may have to consider dropping him, depending on the situation at hand."
,"Kent Bazemore (knee) probable to play: He should be fine and this is likely a precautionary move. Bazemore played great in his 20 minutes on Wednesday, scoring 19 points in a win. He won't play the Nets this time around, so he likely won't be quite as successful. He's worth a look, but there's risk involved."
,"Will Barton (foot) ruled out for Friday: Not surprising, as Barton had been downgraded to doubtful earlier in the day. Barton's minutes have been trending in the wrong direction recently due to the return of both Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler, so if you play in a league without an IR spot, it's understandable if you need to cut Barton loose in order to free up a roster spot during the fantasy playoffs."
,"Mike Dunleavy (ankle) probable for Saturday: Dunleavy had missed approximately a month due to the ankle, and then returned on March 22nd and played four games, before being forced to miss Wednesday's game due to a reaggravation. Dunleavy averaged just 4.0 points in 16.8 minutes during those four games he played last week. He should be left on waivers in all leagues."
,"Joe Harris out again: The Nets haven't updated him too much and he could be out for the season."
,"Quincy Acy will not play Saturday: He is dealing with ankle soreness and the Nets may opt to shut him down. Justin Hamilton will be the backup behind Brook Lopez."
,"Brandon Ingram goes through partial practice: It wasn't a full practice for the No. 2 pick, but coach Luke Walton said he liked what the rookie did. Ingram has been expected to play for Saturday, assuming everything went well in the practice sessions and he doesn't have a setback. If he's back, he should take minutes from David Nwaba and Corey Brewer. Ingram is worth a look in deeper leagues."
,"Ivica Zubac (ankle sprain) out for season: He is going to be re-evaluated in two weeks, so there's basically no chance Zubac will be back during his rookie campaign. X-rays were negative for a fracture on Thursday, so hopefully he can start his offseason program in late April. With Zubac out for the season, Larry Nance figures to get some decent minutes as the Lakers go small while Tarik Black and Thomas Robinson get some added minutes. Nance is worth a pickup in standard leagues."
,"Paul Millsap (left knee) practices on Friday: That's a great sign after he missed the past seven games with left knee synovitis. Millsap also needed a non-surgical procedure earlier this week after an MRI revealed the damage. He has been ruled out for Saturday against the Bulls, but it seems like Sunday against the Nets is a real possibility. After the Sunday game, the Hawks are off for a few days before Thursday's game against the Celtics, so he should have a good chance to play in that one."
,"Michael Beasley (knee) available to play: He's missed the last 17 games due to his hyperextended knee. The Bucks seem to have found a good rotation since Beasley went down with more Giannis Antetokounmpo as a power forward, but they may have to shift some guys around with no Malcolm Brogdon (back) today. Still, it's tough to trust Beasley to get noteworthy minutes in his first game back."
,"Barton (foot) downgraded to doubtful Friday: With Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari healthy, Barton has seen his playing time reduced recently. Barton is averaging just 21.6 minutes over Denver's last three games. If you have been looking for an excuse to send Barton to the waiver wire in favor of a more enticing pickup, you can use this foot injury as that reason."
,"Thabo Sefolosha (groin) ruled out Saturday: This will be the fourth straight game Thabo has missed. Taurean Prince has started each of Atlanta's last three games and is averaging 13.7 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 1.3 treys in 36.4 minutes over those three starts. He should be locked and loaded in fantasy lineups on Saturday."
,"Waiters (ankle) remains without a timetable: 'The swelling has gone down considerably,' coach Erik Spoelstra said. 'He's still going through the process of more mobility and movement.' However, it's beginning to look like Waiters may not be anywhere close to 100 percent by the end of the regular season. Josh Richardson has started six straight games for Miami and is averaging over 34 minutes per contest in those six starts."
,"Salah Mejri (knee) says he will play Friday: Mejri is currently listed as questionable. Minimal fantasy impact here, as Mejri is averaging just 1.9 points and 3.2 rebounds in 9.5 minutes since the All-Star break."
,"Anthony Tolliver (rest) will not play Friday: This is the third time the Kings have rested Tolliver over the past two weeks. There will likely be another game or two he sits out before the regular season wraps up. Skal Labissiere and Georgios Papagiannis should get a bump with Tolliver out."
,"Kosta Koufos (rest) will not play Friday: This will be the second straight game Koufos has missed. Willie Cauley-Stein, Skal Labissiere and Georgios Papagiannis should see additional playing time with Kosta on the sidelines."
,"Ty Lawson (rest) will not play Friday night: The Kings will also be without Arron Afflalo (personal), Kosta Koufos (rest) and Anthony Tolliver (rest) on Friday. Darren Collison should see an uptick in playing time with Lawson sidelined. Tyreke Evans and Langston Galloway and may see a few additional minutes as well."
,"Green (back) to miss at least two more games: Green has already missed four straight games due to the back issue. Mario Hezonja has logged additional minutes with Green sidelined, but Mario has been anything but super. Over Orlando's last four games, Hezonja is averaging just 5.3 points (while shooting 24.2 percent from the floor and 21.4 percent from 3-point territory) in 23.0 minutes per contest."
,"Afflalo, Koufos and Tolliver out on Friday: Afflalo has been in and out of the lineup over the last few weeks. He has played in just two of the Kings last seven games. He belongs on waivers in all leagues. Buddy Hield will continue to start and log heavy minutes at shooting guard."
,"Aaron Gordon (shoulder) a GTD on Friday: Gordon seems to have moved past the minor hip injury that was bothering him as recently as last week, but is now dealing with a shoulder issue. Jeff Green (back) has already been ruled out for Friday, which means the Magic would be thin in the frontcourt if Gordon is unable to suit up. Mario Hezonja may be asked to start if Orlando chooses to go small, or they could go big and start Bismack Biyombo alongside Nikola Vucevic. Check back later in the afternoon for an update."
,"Taj Gibson (illness) questionable for Friday: Gibson's playing time and production have been up-and-down since his trade to OKC. Over the Thunder's last six games, Gibson is averaging 8.2 points and 3.8 rebounds in just 19.4 minutes. He can be left on waivers in standard leagues."
,"Andrew Harrison (ankle) questionable Friday: Harrison injured his ankle Wednesday vs. the Pacers. If he is unable to play on Friday, Troy Daniels will likely see some extra playing time. Wade Baldwin may log a few minutes as well."
,"Tiago Splitter (calf) is probable for Friday: Splitter made his Sixers debut on Tuesday (two points, three rebounds and one block in seven minutes) and then picked up a DNP-CD on Wednesday. He may see a few minutes of action on Friday but certainly should be left on waivers in all leagues."
,"Gerald Henderson (hip) probable for Friday: Henderson is averaging 6.2 points and shooting just 27.9 percent from the floor in 17.9 minutes over his last six games. He should be left on waivers in all leagues."
,"Malcolm Brogdon (back) will not play Friday: Brogdon missed two games earlier this month due to back issues which have apparently resurfaced. Matthew Dellavedova will most likely slide back into the starting lineup. Delly has started 49 games this season and is averaging 8.0 points and 5.2 assists in those 49 starts. Jason Terry will backup Dellavedova and likely log 20-plus minutes off the bench."
,"JaMychal Green (shoulder) ruled out Friday: Marc Gasol (foot) has also been ruled out of Friday's contest. Both Green and Gasol missed Wednesday's game as well. James Ennis and Brandan Wright started in the frontcourt on Wednesday. Ennis finished with six points and 10 boards in 32 minutes. Wright had 13 points and four rebounds in 28 minutes. Zach Randolph tallied 17 points and six boards in 25 minutes off the bench."
,"Marc Gasol (foot) will not play Friday night: This will be the fourth straight game Gasol has missed. Unfortunately, owners in the playoffs this week may need to cut Gasol to free up a valuable roster spot. Brandan Wright started in place of Gasol on Wednesday and tallied 13 points and four rebounds in 28 minutes. Zach Randolph will also see an uptick in playing time, especially with JaMychal Green (shoulder) also ruled out of Friday's game."
,"Darrell Arthur (knee) ruled out Friday night: Arthur, who has been battling nagging knee injuries all season, was a DNP-CD on Tuesday and has appeared in only two of the Nuggets last eight games. He belongs on the wire in all leagues."
,"Brian Roberts (personal) questionable Friday: Minimal fantasy impact here, as Roberts has appeared in just three of the Hornets last six games. Briante Weber will log a few additional minutes if Roberts is unable to play on Friday."
,"Will Barton (foot) says he will play Friday: Barton has not missed any games recently but was listed as questionable for Friday's contest. Also, Barton's minutes have been trending in the wrong direction of late, with both Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari now healthy. Barton is averaging 10.3 points and 2.7 rebounds in just 21.6 minutes over Denver's last three games."
,"Mason Plumlee (abdominal) will play Friday: With the Nuggets frontcourt finally healthy, Plumlee has seen his minutes reduced dramatically. He was scoreless in the Nuggets loss to the Blazers on Tuesday and is averaging just 17.2 minutes per game over Denver's last three contests. He can be sent to waivers in standard leagues."
,"Derrick Rose (knee) a GTD on Friday night: Coach Jeff Hornacek said that both Rose and Carmelo Anthony (back) will 'try to go at shootaround and see how they feel.' If Rose, who also missed Wednesday's game due to the knee injury, is unable to play Friday, Ron Baker would likely draw another start. Baker played 40 minutes on Wednesday, finishing with six points, five boards and three assists. Chasson Randle also logged 21 minutes on Wednesday."
,"Carmelo Anthony (back) a GTD on Friday: Anthony injured his back in Wednesday's game vs. the Pistons in a collision with Aron Baynes. In addition, the Knicks were officially eliminated from the playoffs on Wednesday. Thus, their motivation now is ping pong balls, not wins, and they have no reason to rush Melo back onto the court. If Melo is unable to play on Friday, Mindaugas Kuzminskas would likely slide into the starting lineup. Derrick Rose (knee) is also questionable. If both Rose and Melo are out, Kristaps Porzingis will see his usage rate spike."
,"Lance Thomas (hip) listed as out for Friday: Thomas has missed four straight game due to the hip ailment. He should be left on waivers in all formats. Kristaps Porzingis, Willy Hernangomez and Kyle O'Quinn will continue to log a few extra minutes apiece with Thomas sidelined."
,"Raps focused on re-signing Kyle Lowry: The Raps will be able to offer far more money over more years than any other team; the only question is are they willing to commit max money to a 31-year old point guard coming off wrist surgery. Ujiri sang the praises of his star, saying that 'before the injury, you could argue [Lowry] was one of the top five players in the league this season.' It will be interesting to see how it all plays out this summer. Lowry may be able to return for the final handful of regular season games this year, but he's still without an official timetable for his return.
"
,"Salah Mejri (knee) questionable for Friday: Mejri missed Wednesday's game due to the knee issue. Dwight Powell soaked up most of Mejri's playing time. Powell logged 15 minutes off the bench on Wednesday and would likely see a similar allotment on Friday if Mejri can't play. This is a situation to avoid from a fantasy perceptive."
,"Ricky Rubio: 'I feel the best I've ever felt': 'Starting the season, I wasn't feeling that good and now I feel the best I've ever felt,' said Rubio. The dramatic spike in Rubio's production has been incredible. In the 17 games played since the All-Star break, Rubio is averaging 16.8 points, 10.5 assists, 4.5 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 1.2 treys, while shooting 46.3 percent from the floor, 43.8 percent from 3-point territory and 91.4 percent from the free throw line. Fantasy owners couldn't possibly ask for more."
,"Ivica Zubac (ankle) wearing a protective boot: Zubac seemed more optimistic than the Lakers coaching staff. 'Theres always a chance of good news,' said Zubac. 'I think its going to be okay.' He will be reevaluated on Friday, and we should have an update shortly thereafter. However, coach Luke Walton noted that high-ankle sprains tend to sideline players much longer than standard sprains. At this point, Zubac should be considered highly questionable for Saturday's game against the Clippers."
,"Brandon Ingram (knee) says he felt 'no pain': 'I wanted to get back on the court. I think it was important for me to get back on the court,' said Ingram. Coach Luke Walton told reporters that Ingram could play in Saturday's game vs. the Clippers if he didn't suffer any setbacks in Friday's practice. We can expect an update after the practice. This could come down to a game-time decision on Saturday. Even if Ingram is cleared, the Lakers will likely limit his minutes, making him difficult to trust for fantasy purposes."
,"Montrezl Harrell (personal) to return Friday: Harrell missed the last two games due to the birth of his daughter. Nene (rest) will not play on Friday, which means Harrell will back up Clint Capela and run with the second unit. Coach Mike D'Antoni praised Harrell's unselfishness this season. 'He's not displayed anything other than a willingness to be a good teammate and play well when he gets a chance. That's commendable. That's harder than it looks,' said D'Antoni."
,"Allen Crabbe helps Blazers win, scores 17: One of his steals turned out to be a turning point of the game and Crabbe played an all-around great game tonight. He disappeared on Tuesday with two points on 1-of-8 shooting against the Nuggets, but has scored in double figures in seven of his last nine games, and five of his last six. He's a good source of 3-pointers and can get hot at any time, but his four steals tonight were a bit of a fluke. He's still a borderline fantasy player right now, but the Blazers play four times, next week, meaning he's worth a look, especially if you need treys."
,"Noah Vonleh cooling off for Blazers: He had been getting solid minutes recently, but was simply outplayed by both Moe Harkless and Al-Farouq Aminu tonight, and both players had a big role in a very tough, and important, win. Vonleh may hold onto the starting job and is still averaging 25 minutes over his last five games, but Aminu is coming on and Vonleh is only averaging 4.4 points and 7.4 boards over his last five. If Aminu does it again on Saturday against the Suns, Vonleh's flame may have burned out."
,"Al-Farouq Aminu plays well in win over HOU: Noah Vonleh was nearly invisible in 15 minutes tonight and Aminu and Moe Harkless really came through for the Blazers in this one. Aminu is heating up again, despite coming off the bench, and is averaging 15 points and nine boards over his last two games, and 11.4 points, 8.6 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 1.0 3-pointers on 51 percent shooting over his last five. If he was dropped in your league, it looks like it may be time to pick him up, as he's also averaging 28 minutes over his last five games."
,"James Harden has season-low four assists: He was just 2-of-13 from deep, didn't have any assists in the fourth quarter, and snapped a nine-game streak with double-digit dimes. Harden's left wrist was a problem and he was getting treatment on it in the second half. The Rockets will travel to Golden State for Friday and there has to be a chance Harden gets a night off based on how he didn't play well today -- credit Moe Harkless and Allen Crabbe for their defense, as well. He also set a career high for 3-pointers in a season while the Rockets also broke the NBA record for most team threes in a season. The Rockets won't shoot around on Friday, but hopefully we get an update on Harden's status Friday afternoon."
,"C.J. McCollum struggles, but Blazers beat HOU: McCollum got a face full of Trevor Ariza and Eric Gordon tonight, and just never got on track. Luckily for the Blazers, Damian Lillard, Jusuf Nurkic and Moe Harkless all came through with huge stat lines, while Al-Farouq Aminu and Allen Crabbe both played well off the bench. McCollum should bounce back against the Suns on Saturday."
,"Damian Lillard double-doubles in huge win: Lillard pretty much dominated James Harden tonight, scoring more points, handing out more assists and committing just three turnovers to Harden's six. The Blazers are fighting for their playoff lives and Lillard came through in a big way on a night when C.J. McCollum just wasn't feeling it. Lillard isn't going to get many MVP votes, if any, but this was an MVP-type performance tonight. The Blazers now sit 1.5 games ahead of the Nuggets for the final playoff spot in the West and have won five straight games, rejuvenated by center Jusuf Nurkic."
,"Trevor Ariza puts up big line in loss: He joins Kyrie Irving and Chris Paul as the only players with at least six steals in consecutive games this season. Ariza is about as hot as it gets over his last three, averaging 18.0 points, 5.0 boards, 3.7 assists, 5.0 steals and 3.3 treys. His boom-or-busy ways can be annoying, but his fantasy owners have to be loving it right now."
,"Nurk Alert: Jusuf Nurkic keying Blazers run: The Blazers have gotten a massive boost from Nurkic since he was traded by the Nuggets and it now looks like they're in the driver's seat to snag the No. 8 seed in the West, holding a 1.5 game lead over Denver. Nurkic has quickly become a fan favorite in Portland and his newfound passion has been on display ever since he got off the plane at PDX. The Blazers have now won five straight and while tonight's win over Houston was easily the toughest test out of that stretch, Nurk is averaging a whopping 18.2 points, 11.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.6 blocks on 52 percent shooting over his last five games. Rip City, baby."
,"Lou Williams scores 14 points vs. Blazers: If not for his ridiculous Sunday with 31 points and 7-of-8 from deep, Williams would be freezing cold. In his other six games over that seven-game span, he's missed all 22 attempts from beyond the arc. Williams is still going to get heavy minutes and shots, especially with Ryan Anderson (ankle) out and possibly because James Harden is limited as a shooter. Keep him rolling and just hope he snaps out of it against the Warriors."
,"Moe Harkless explodes for 17 points, 3 blocks: He also played incredible defense against James Harden, prompting coach Terry Stotts to say 'I thought he was very conscientious' after the game. Harkless has been really bad for a couple weeks now and the 17 points are the most he's scored since he had 18 on March 4. Noah Vonleh was very quiet tonight and Harkless looked fantastic against the Rockets, but he's still not the most trustworthy player around. The 32 minutes he got tonight were his most since he played 33 on March 11, and he only played 14 minutes on Tuesday. Harkless may have been dropped in your league recently and there were good reasons for that happening. Just keep an eye on him and if he does this again against the Suns on Saturday, then think about grabbing him for next week."
,"Nene likely out for Friday: He played 23 minutes against the Blazers on Thursday, scoring 14 points with seven rebounds and four assists. This will be planned rest for Nene, so there should be some Montrezl Harrell in the second unit."
,"Devin Booker scores 33 points vs. Clippers: It's the fifth time he's fouled out this season, so that's nothing new for the 20-year-old guard. Booker's ankle injury looked totally fine during this game with points all over the court, including six attempts at the line. The Suns do have a back-to-back set coming up on Saturday with a game in Portland, so Booker's fantasy owners will have to make sure he's a go for that one."
,"T.J. Warren scores 14 with 10 boards: The rebounding numbers have been a serious trend for Warren. While he only has five double-doubles in his career, he's posted four of those in his last 11 active games. Warren is locked and loaded for big minutes as the No. 2 scoring option for the Suns going forward. He should be owned in all standard leagues."
,"DeAndre Jordan grabs 17 boards on Thursday: Jordan is averaging 14.2 points, 15.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks over his last five games and the Clippers have just two games next week. If you can find a player that will give you more than 28 points, 32 boards and four blocks for the week, owners will have to consider putting DJ on the bench."
,"Marquese Chriss scores 20 points vs. Clips: He guarded Blake Griffin a lot in this game and he managed to avoid serious foul trouble -- he does have five fouls in three of his last four. Chriss went back to getting some dunks in this game while he did attempt five shots from deep. Chriss also played some center minutes, which has been an advantageous position for him most of this season. Despite some inconsistent play, Chriss should be owned in standard leagues."
,"Jamal Crawford scores 19 points in 27 minutes: With the Clippers playing just two games next week, Crawford should probably be on your bench or waivers if you're playing for a fantasy championship. Picking up a guy like Kris Dunn, who has five games, could be a game-changer for owners of Crawford."
,"Alex Len scores 12 points in loss: He held his own in the paint against DeAndre Jordan. Len has struggled against some bigger fives due to giving up position, but he's been much better in that regard lately. His fantasy owners should be pleased with his output over his last five, averaging 10.8 points, 6.0 boards, 1.4 blocks and 1.0 steals. Plus, Alan Williams has taken a step back in the last two weeks. Len is worth owning in standard leagues."
,"J.J. Redick scores 14 vs. Suns: Redick was coming off a season-high 31 points on Wednesday, but was pedestrian tonight. With Austin Rivers out, Redick and Jamal Crawford each played heavy minutes, but neither player did much of anything but scoring. The Clippers play just two games next week, meaning that players like Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan are probably worth a shot, while fantasy owners of Redick and Crawford can probably find some better options on the waiver wire."
,"Alan Williams scores six points: He's had some issues holding the ball again and had one of the ugliest floaters of the month off a great pass from Tyler Ulis. Williams is also struggling in free throw percentage, making just 50.0 percent from there since returning from illness last week. Williams has lost some of his luster in fantasy leagues with a downward trend in minutes."
,"Chris Paul double-doubles in win: Paul is fully healthy and rolling right now, and the Clippers are still fighting for playoff position. They're within striking distance of Utah and are still trying to hold off the Thunder for the No. 5 seed. Hopefully CP3 is good to go the rest of the way after missing half of January and most of February. In hindsight, that rest likely helped him and should have him ready for the postseason, as well as a push down the stretch for seeding position. The only problem is that the Clippers only have two games next week, meaning owners in weekly leagues may have some lineup decisions to make on Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin."
,"Derrick Jones Jr. comes off bench: As per usual, he had some highlight-reel plays with a tomahawk dunk in this loss. Jones Jr.  has been better than expected, but he's still not close to having fantasy value in standard leagues."
,"Blake Griffin scores 31 in win over Suns: Griffin just missed a triple-double with 26 points, 10 boards and nine assists on Wednesday, and he's clearly putting his team on his back down the stretch. The Clippers are tracking the Jazz and trying to hold off the Thunder in the West and currently hold the No. 5 seed. They could easily move up or down, depending on if they win or lose, so the hope is that they keep playing their studs."
,"Raul Neto out again on Friday: It'll be his second consecutive game out. The Jazz will have Dante Exum and Shelvin Mack split the minutes at the point while Mack offers a better fantasy upside in deep leagues."
,"Derrick Favors out again on Friday for Jazz: We still don't know when he'll be back in action, if at all, and Trey Lyles and Boris Diaw aren't really helpful in fantasy. Joe Ingles and Joe Johnson are worth a look and might get a few more minutes than they would if Favors was playing. The lost season for Favors is almost in the books."
,"George Hill (groin) will not play vs. Wizards: He suffered the injury on Monday and will be missing his second straight game. On Wednesday, Dante Exum did not score in his 23 minutes while Shelvin Mack scored 14 points off the bench. Mack is probably the better play for DFS, but it's a big gamble on such a busy night. Hill's fantasy owners may have to consider dropping him."
,"KCP arrested for suspicion of DUI: He was ticketed for operating a vehicle while intoxicated after he was pulled over around 2:50 a.m. in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The arrest came hours after a loss to the Heat on Tuesday night, but KCP was active for action on Thursday against the Nets."
,"Zubac to be evaluated on Friday.: He is going to be re-evaluated on Los Angeles on Friday. The Lakers have a matinee affair against the Clippers on Saturday, so it would be a big surprise to see Zubac suit up for that game or even Sunday afternoon against the Grizzlies. Larry Nance is worth a look in standard leagues while Thomas Robinson and Tarik Black also benefit for owners in deep leagues looking to stream a big man on a back-to-back set to finish the week."
,"Jimmy Butler scores 25 points in win vs. CLE: That's another TNT home win to make it 19 straight for the Bulls in that situation. The Bulls have also swept the season series against the Cavs 4-0 to help put them just 1.0 games behind the Pacers and Heat, who are tied for seeds No. 7 and 8. As for Jimmy, he was hit in the eye and had to go to the locker room early in the first half. He did return and looked fine, but Butler had an eye patch after the game and said he's calling himself 'One Eyed Willie, like from The Goonies.' Butler should be all set for a big game against the Hawks on Saturday."
,"Robin Lopez double-doubles vs. Cavs: After a day off last Wednesday and a one-point dud on Friday, Ro-Lo has come through with nice games in two straight. The Bulls are fighting for their playoff lives and sit 1.0 games behind the Pacers for the final playoff spot in the East currently. If Lopez is available and you're in the fantasy playoffs, he might be worth grabbing since the Bulls will need him to play well the rest of the way."
,"Rajon Rondo torches Cavs with 7-9-15 line: Rondo was awful offensively tonight, but made up for it everywhere else. Rondo is the first Bull to log 15 dimes since Derrick Rose had 16 way back in 2011. Rondo just missed a triple-double in his last game with an 18-9-9 line, so he's getting hot just when the Bulls, and fantasy owners, need him most. The Bulls currently sit 1.0 games behind the Pacers for the final playoff spot in the East, while the loss for the Cavs knocked them back to the No. 2 seed, a 1/2 game behind the Celtics."
,"Nikola Mirotic ties season high with 28: Miro was en fuego and the 28 points tied his season high, and he's actually scored exactly 28 in three of his last four games. He also became the first Bull in history to hit six 3-pointers in back-to-back games and the Bulls have hit 10 or more in five straight, also a franchise record. It wasn't that long ago that Mirotic wasn't trustworthy because he was highly unpredictable, but he's crushing it right now. Over his last four games he's averaging 24.8 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.0 3-pointers while hitting 37-of-54 shots, good for 69 percent! If you were lucky enough to pick him up recently, he might just win you a championship."
,"Denzel Valentine scores 12 points vs. Cavs: His minutes have been there with 28.6 per game over his last five, averaging 7.2 points, 4.4 boards, 1.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 2.0 treys. Valentine could wind up being a specialist for treys with some steals and points to go with it, but he's only an option in deep leagues."
,"Cris Felicio gets a DNP-CD: Coach Fred Hoiberg did not get Felicio out there despite saying he was available. This could have been about the matchup to try to limit the 3-pointers in the second unit, or maybe Hoiberg just wanted to wait one more. Whatever the case, Robin Lopez's minutes look safer than usual."
,"LeBron James scores 26 points in loss to CHI: It's not pretty in The Land right now. In their previous 15 games, the Cavs were dead last in defensive rating, which explains why they've gone just 6-10 in March. 'We're in a bad spot right now,' James said after the game. He also didn't have his usual postgame icing sessions, so keep an eye out to make sure he's a go for Friday against the 76ers. Regarding milestones, LeBron passed Shaquille O'Neal for seventh on the NBA's all-time scoring list."
,"Kris Dunn quiet in his 30 minutes Thursday: Dunn has been playing heavy shooting guard minutes lately, but hasn't done a whole lot in his last two games, outside of stealing the ball. But he's averaging 28.8 minutes over his last five and could easily get hot again soon. He had a 17-point game last Saturday, so don't be surprised if he has another big line or two in his near future. And if you need steals, Dunn is racking them up at a furious pace, averaging 2.8 of them to go along with 8.8 points, 4.2 rebounds and a block over his last five games. The bonus of picking up Dunn right now is that he has a five-game week next week, which could really help a fantasy team win a championship."
,"Ricky Rubio scores career-high 33 in win: 'He's got a lot of confidence in his shot right now,' coach Tom Thibodeau said prior to the game. His confidence level got another boost tonight and after a sluggish start to the season, is now one of the most exciting players in the NBA from day to day."
,"Kyrie Irving scores 20 points: He did suffer a mild ankle tweak in this game, but he stayed in the game and only was limping for a few seconds. Irving just wasn't able to get it going and even picked up the third tech of his career. The Cavs can't get out of their own way right now and coach Ty Lue may have to figure out what he wants to do with rest. Irving should be playing on Friday, but his owners should definitely check back before the Cavs take on the 76ers."
,"Karl-Anthony Towns plays well in win over LA: Towns does it all, doesn't miss games and doesn't even make news with lines like the one he posted tonight, because it's what he does every night. If you want to take him with the No. 1 pick in fantasy leagues next season, you're not going to get much of an argument from us."
,"Kevin Love comes out flat in Chicago: Not great. He just didn't seem interested in this game and had some lazy fouls throughout. Love has been a shell of himself in the last five games, averaging just 11.6 points, 8.6 boards, 2.6 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.8 blocks and 1.4 treys on 38.9 percent from the field. His fantasy owners have to start him, but he's a tough guy to trust in DFS until further notice. Maybe he needs a game off."
,"Andrew Wiggins scores 27 in loss to Lakers: Wiggins has had a big season and typically does some of his best work against the Lakers, although a lack of peripheral stats does offset his ability to score. He dropped 36 against the Lakers on Friday and the two teams meet again on April 9. If the Wolves are still playing their studs, Wiggins should be a solid DFS play that night."
,"Iman Shumpert scores four points: The Cavs may need to make some changes to their rotation, but giving more shots and/or minutes to Shumpert probably isn't the answer."
,"Gorgui Dieng posts big line in win vs. Lakers: Leave it to the Lakers to give up one of Dieng's best lines of the season, if not ever. Dieng was coming in hot though and has now scored in double digits in four straight games. Dieng has turned it around in the past 10 days or so, averaging 13.2 points, 7.6 rebounds, 2.8 dimes, 1.2 steals, 2.0 blocks and 0.8 3-pointers over his last five games."
,"Channing Frye scores five points: He did pick up some extra minutes today because of Kevin Love being in foul trouble while he should also play more if Richard Jefferson (knee) needs to miss time. Frye still won't have enough value to trust while the Cavs are somewhat healthy."
,"Thomas Robinson scores 12 in 14 minutes: Ivica Zubac went down with a high-ankle sprain so the Lakers will be using a combination of Tarik Black, Larry Nance and T-Rob to fill the gaps. Nance is probably the best bet for success, but Black and Robinson could also see a boost if Zubac misses as much time as we think he might."
,"J.R. Smith scores 12 points: The Cavs just haven't been good since Smith has returned. In the previous 72 minutes of the current starting lineup this month, that group has posted a woeful -22.0 net rating due to just disastrous defense, so maybe coach Ty Lue may want to make a change. While this was Smith's best stat line since returning from injury, we'd like to see him do it a couple more times before adding him."
,"David Nwaba plays 30 minutes in loss: Nwaba has played at least 23 minutes in four straight games and is averaging 6.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 0.8 steals over that stretch. He's not someone worth grabbing in most leagues, but if the minutes stick, he could fully breakout at any time. Just keep in mind he could return to a lesser role once Brandon Ingram returns from his knee issue."
,"Tarik Black scores season-high 15 in loss: Ivica Zubac went down with a high-ankle sprain and Black started the second half in his place. However, Black's offensive skills are limited and there's a decent chance that it could be Larry Nance that ends up blowing up if Zubac is done for the season. Black might be worth a deep-league flier until we see how this goes, but Nance looks like a better fantasy option to us."
,"Deron Williams doesn't score: Coach Ty Lue tried Williams more with some first-unit guys, but it didn't work and Williams hasn't been very good since his arrival. Williams won't be worth using unless Kyrie Irving gets game off, and that may not even be the case with how poorly he's played lately."
,"Larry Nance about to get more minutes?: Ivica Zubac went down with a high ankle sprain and it's possible his season is over. And if that's the case, Tarik Black may get the starts, but Nance could easily be the guy who steps up in his place. If you're looking for a big man who can help you off waivers, the time looks right for Nance."
,"Marcus Morris scores 28 with 13 boards: Those 13 boards matched a season high in what was arguably his best game of the season besides his 37-point game against the Blazers on Feb. 28. Morris' shot distribution was unusual with only four attempts from the line, one shot at the rim and that one 3-pointer, so he had some success on two-point jumpers. Morris has been alternating duds with 20-point games over his last four, so maybe he can't crack 10 against the Bucks on Friday. He's only a borderline player to own."
,"D'Angelo Russell struggles with shot in loss: Despite not having his offense working tonight, Russell still played a ton of minutes, hit some treys, handed out some dimes and swiped some steals. Russell and Jordan Clarkson are the guards of choice for the Lakers right now and it appears that will be the case the rest of the way. Russell had a pretty epic game on Tuesday with 28 points, nine assists and four 3-pointers, but his shot just wasn't working early in this one."
,"Jordan Clarkson scores 18 in 40 minutes: Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell (38 minutes) are getting most of the guard minutes for the Lakers these days and both are must-own players. Russell couldn't get his shot going tonight, but Clarkson played pretty well in another Lakers loss."
,"Ish Smith scores 21 points in win vs. Nets: He came through in the clutch with seven points in the final three minutes of this game to avoid what would have been a devastating lost to the NBA's worst team. Reggie Jackson has missed the last three games and there's no word of him getting back out there, so Smith should continue to see minutes in the low 30s. He could destroy you in field goal percentage, but Smith is worth owning for anyone needing a point guard."
,"Jon Leuer quiet in starting lineup: He scored just two points in the starting lineup on Tuesday and just isn't in a good groove right now. Back in the preseason, coach Stan Van Gundy said he wanted Leuer and Ish Smith to play off each other, but it's not working out for Leuer right now. Leave him on the wire."
,"Tobias Harris scores eight points: Marcus Morris was on fire, so that explains the hit in playing time for Harris in this game. The move to the bench shouldn't hurt Tobias because he's actually scored more points per game off the bench than he has as the starter and has better efficiency. The Pistons need him to score when Morris isn't playing lights out, so keep Harris rolling in all lineups."
,"Stanley Johnson doesn't score: The Pistons may get a look at Johnson at some point next month, but he's just not playing well enough to stash in almost any fantasy league."
,"Andre Drummond scores just two points: His only shot from the field was a little floater in the paint and he missed it. Obviously Drummond's offensive game is in shambles these days, failing to score more than 10 points in any of his last five. In that span, he averaged just 7.0 points, 14.0 boards, 1.8 assists, 1.2 blocks and 0.8 steals on 45.7 percent from the field and 17.6 percent from the line. The 23-year-old center has regressed big time."
,"Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scores 14 in 30 mins: That's double-digit scoring in a career-high four straight games, and more importantly he's played at least 24 minutes in three straight. The Pistons actually put Andre Drummond on his during this game, which does highlight how RHJ needs to make his jumpers. Still, he's trending up and is worth a pickup with games on Saturday and Sunday."
,"Brook Lopez scores just 11 points: His 49.6 March field goal percentage was his best full month this year, but Lopez couldn't find his jumper for the first three quarters to drop him on the entire month. He also hit at least 2.0 treys per game this month, which is the second time he's accomplished that feat in a full month this season. While the Nets haven't been resting Lopez in back-to-back sets lately, his fantasy owners will want to check back on Saturday to make sure he's a go."
,"Jeremy Lin plays 31 minutes vs. Detroit: He played 30 minutes on Tuesday and has seen a steady increase in playing time this month. The Nets have been cautious with Lin on a back-to-back set, so Lin could be in the upper 20s on Saturday against the Magic. He should still have enough value in that playing time to use in most leagues, but check back to make sure he's not getting a game off."
,"Justin Hamilton scores six in 17 minutes: Quincy Acy (ankle) is dealing with some soreness and did not play, so Hamilton picked up the backup center minutes. If for some reason the Nets do opt to rest Brook Lopez in the upcoming back-to-back set, Hamilton may be a viable stream of DFS punt."
,"Sean Kilpatrick scores 15 points vs. DET: After just 12 minutes in his return on Tuesday, coach Kenny Atkinson gave Kilpatrick his usual playing time off the bench. The Nets do have a back-to-back over the weekend and they've been burned by hamstring aggravations all year, so there's a chance they rest Kilpatrick in one of those. He's not worth owning in most leagues."
,"Tarik Black starts 3Q for Zubac: He should be picking up some minutes this week with Zubac likely to miss time here. Larry Nance should also benefit and is the better pickup here."
,"Jimmy Butler starts second half for Bulls: He went to the locker room to have his left eye checked on, but started the second half despite having limited vision in his left eye. Hopefully it will heal quickly and he won't miss any time, as the Bulls clearly need him right now if they're going to have a shot at making the playoffs."
,"Jimmy Butler (eye) goes to locker room: It looked like he got hit in the eye and was having trouble with his vision as the second quarter was winding down. Our guess is he'll be able to play in the second half, but we'll know more once halftime is over."
,"Derrick Jones Jr. back to the bench: Devin Booker is ready to roll for this game, but Airplane Mode should still get minutes around 20 today. He doesn't have enough offensive upside to trust in most leagues."
,"Leandro Barbosa will not play vs. Clips: The Suns really don't have much incentive to play him and it should be Ronnie Price as the backup point guard. Tyler Ulis should play a ton."
,"Devin Booker (ankle) will start against Clips: He's back after missing his last game on Tuesday. Booker will have to share the ball with T.J. Warren, but he still has a high ceiling against J.J. Redick and the Clippers. Get him in your lineup."
,"Austin Rivers (hamstring) out for season?: When describing the hamstring strain, the coach said it's 'a pretty good one.' It sounds like Rivers is not going to play during the regular season due to the injury he suffered on Wednesday night. That means more minutes should be going to J.J. Redick and Jamal Crawford. Plus, coach Doc Rivers may add Wes Johnson into the mix or give some run to Luc Mbah a Moute."
,"Ivica Zubac (right ankle) will not return: X-rays were negative for the injury Zubac suffered after just two minutes of action. He went straight to the locker room and chances are he could be missing more time. The Lakers have a back-to-back set starting on Saturday, so consider Zubac very questionable for that game. If he can't go, Tarik Black figures to benefit the most, but he's not a great fantasy option. High-ankle sprains usually take weeks to heal, so Zubac's owners may want to consider dropping him."
,"Suns want Dragan Bender to play: Coach Earl Watson said it 'should be pretty close' for Bender to make his debut. He has been doing some on-court work and does warm up with the team. The Suns will be limiting him upon his return, but his return would likely take minutes away from Jared Dudley."
,"Leandro Barbosa (hamstring) a game-time call: We probably won't get an update on Barbosa here, but for now assume he's not going to play. If he is out, Jarell Eddie and Ronnie Price would play more."
,"Devin Booker (ankle) is a game-time call: The Suns are right in the thick of a lottery-ball chase with the Lakers, so they may just hold out their best player. Booker has been dealing with some soreness from a couple weeks, so sitting would be for a legitimate reason. If he's out, Jarell Eddie would be in the rotation while T.J. Warren and plenty of Suns would get more shots."
,"Ivica Zubac (ankle) to the locker room: He rolled his ankle after a post-move shot and limped straight to the locker room. Zubac was able to walk to the locker room under his own power, but he was moving slowly. Tarik Black replaced him and would play more if Zubac is out."
,"Kevon Looney (hip) doubtful for Friday: He missed Wednesday's game and hasn't been in the rotation anyway. Looney had left hip surgery last year and he's had plenty of hip problems in his career. Expect the Warriors to take it slow with him."
,"Cam Payne will not play on Thursday: He is inactive and clearly the Bulls aren't in a rush to bring along their point guard of the future as they make a push for the No. 8 seed."
,"Brandon Ingram hopeful to practice Friday: In case you missed, it, he is not going to play on Thursday night. Ingram's knee tendinitis is not expected to be serious and he could return to game action at some point this season. With him out, it's been David Nwaba and Corey Brewer filling in at the three spot. Nwaba is worth a look if you're desperate for defensive stats."
,"Richard Jefferson (knee) ruled out Thursday: He missed practice on Wednesday and the Cavs will just hold him out. Jefferson plays both forward spots, so there could be more minutes going to J.R. Smith or Iman Shumpert at the three and Channing Frye at the four."
,"Cris Felicio (tailbone) available to play: He has been expected to play all day and should be back after missing the last three games. The Bulls have missed Felicio on defense and giving up 70 paint points to the 76ers on Friday was a clear sign. If Felicio is a full go, Robin Lopez could lose a couple minutes while Joffrey Lauvergne should lose minutes. Most fantasy owners can ignore this situation."
,"Alexis Ajinca (hip) questionable Friday: The Pelicans won't really need him with DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis fully expected to play. Ajinca was not in the rotation on Wednesday."
,"Sergio Rodriguez not feeling pain: He is not going to play in at least the next two games and will be re-evaluated early next week. 'I feel good,' Rodriguez said. T.J. McConnell will continue to see minutes in the mid 30s while Nik Stauskas slides over to the backup PG spot."
,"Lance Stephenson will be available Sunday: Fire up those videos of Lance blowing into LeBron James' ear. Stephenson has had a tough time staying healthy this season and the Pacers will likely only keep him in the teens for minutes. His return would take away from Monta Ellis and C.J. Miles. Plus, Glenn Robinson III would likely not be in the rotation upon his return."
,"Jahlil Okafor ruled out for Friday and Sunday: There's a good chance the 76ers just hold him out for the rest of the season. Plus, the team will likely be trying to trade him based on how they've had better success when Okafor is out of the lineup. Richaun Holmes will look to build off his career-high 25 points while Shawn Long backs him up. Holmes should be owned in all leagues while Long is worth a look in deeper formats. <br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> Richaun Holmes has seen right around 30 minutes in the Sixers previous four games, and it's likely he takes on a similar workload in Cleveland on Friday. The Sixers have next to no depth behind him at the moment - Shawn Long is the only other big competing for much playing time, and he's still being limited to about 16-18 minutes a night. Holmes sets up as a nice upside GPP target on Friday."
,"Robert Covington (knee) out at least 2 games: He's already missed one game with his right knee soreness and had an MRI on Wednesday. Considering the 76ers are in the mix for the No. 4 to No. 8 spot in the lottery, they may just hold Covington out to get a longer look at Justin Anderson and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot. Covington's fantasy owners may have to consider dropping him while Anderson makes for a solid pickup the rest of the week."
,"Pondexter out for the season: He underwent left knee arthroscopic surgery on Jan. 4 and hasn't played all season. Pondexter is under contract for next season, so the Pelicans will be hoping the oft-injured forward can have a healthy offseason."
,"Omer Asik officially out for the season: He was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal infection and is expected to return to basketball activities in 3-4 weeks. The Pelicans may try to move Asik's contract this summer."
,"Marc Gasol (left foot) still day-to-day: 'I think he feels a little better, but I don't know if he'll be ready,' Fizdale said. 'I don't see it right now.' That's not exactly encouraging news for Gasol's status against the Mavs on Friday. If Gasol can't go, Brandan Wright would likely get another start while Zach Randolph also benefits."
,"Carlisle says rest is coming for veterans: In other words, the Mavs losing to the Pelicans on Wednesday has knocked them out of the postseason and the team will get a look at their young players. That means Dirk Nowitzki, Wesley Matthews, Nerlens Noel, J.J. Barea, Devin Harris and Harrison Barnes could be missing time."
,"James Harden says he'll play on Thursday: He had his shooting wrist wrapped at shootaround and he has been playing through it since Mar. 18 when he took a nasty spill at Denver. 'It will get better but if I keep banging on it and keep falling on it then it's going to keep going back too square one,' Harden said Thursday morning. 'I try to limit banging on it and keeping it away from contact, it's kinda hard because it's my left hand. I do a lot with my left hand.' For now, his fantasy owners can plug him in there as he attempts to go for MVP."
,"Darrell Arthur (knee) is questionable Friday: The guy just can't shake his knee issue. Unless you're tanking in your fantasy league, leave Arthur on the wire."
,"Plumlee (abdominal contusion) is questionable: His minutes are way down these days because the Nuggets are playing more small ball with Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari healthy. It also doesn't help that Kenneth Faried has played well off the bench. Plumlee failed to score in 16 minutes vs. the Blazers on Tuesday and belongs on the wire in standard leagues."
,"Will Barton (foot) is questionable for Friday: Barton has seen his minutes drop with Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari healthy, so this new foot issue will give his owners even more incentive to drop him. If Barton sits on Friday, Jamal Murray could get a nice bump in minutes off the bench, but standard-league owners should probably look elsewhere."
,"Brandon Ingram (knee) ruled out Thursday: While he was listed as questionable, coach Luke Walton made it sound like he didn't have a chance of playing in this one. The Lakers aren't considering shutting him down, so his next chance to play is on Saturday vs. the Clippers. The Lakers will start D'Angelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Corey Brewer, Julius Randle and Ivica Zubac. David Nwaba should get some extended run off the bench with Ingram out."
,"Jon Leuer starting again on Thursday: He's still not a great fantasy option and is coming off a poor game on Tuesday when he finished with just two points, four boards, a steal and a block in 17 minutes. As for Tobias Harris, he looked great off the bench with 19 points, six boards, two steals and four 3-pointers. Leuer is more of a deep-leauge streaming option since this is a great matchup."
,"Reggie Jackson (knee) out again Thursday: Despite reports of R-Jax possibly being shut down, coach Stan Van Gundy said earlier this week that the PG is day-to-day. Ish Smith will see a heavy workload in Jackson's absence and is worth a look if you need assists and steals. Beno Udrih will back him up. Jackson's owners should move on if they haven't already."
,"Cristiano Felicio (tailbone) expected to play: Assuming he's ready to return from a three-game absence, Felico could take back his backup center minutes from Joffrey Lauvergene. He's not a realistic fantasy option while Robin Lopez is healthy, though."
,"Kyle Korver (foot) targeting Sunday?: In case you missed it, Korver has been ruled out for Thursday's game vs. the Bulls and Friday's game vs. Philly. The Cavs will need Korver to be at or close to 100 percent for the postseason, so expect his workload to be monitored upon his return. We'll have an update on Friday evening."
,"Richard Jefferson misses practice: It sounds like it was more of a maintenance day, as coach Tyronn Lue said everyone would play vs. the Bulls on Thursday except Kyle Korver (foot). Jefferson isn't a fantasy option anyways with Kevin Love healthy."
,"Lue says Cavs won't rest players Thursday: This means LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving will be a full go. Iman Shumpert (knee) and Richard Jefferson (knee) will play, while Kyle Korver (foot) is still out . The Cavs do play again on Friday vs. Philly, so a DNP-rest could be coming for James, Love and Irving if they see a lot of minutes tonight."
,"Iman Shumpert (knee) is available Thursday: He was 'expected' to play, so there are no surprises here after he went through a full practice on Wednesday. While Shumpert isn't a fantasy option outside of very deep leagues, his return will take away some minutes from J.R. Smith."
,"Dario Saric struggling with fatigue: 'I was tired, really,' Saric said. 'So many games. Like everybody knows, the Olympic games, national team, my professional team, [Andalou Efes Istanbul], how many games in a season. Now I feel like really, really, really bad. I was so excited in my head, in my heart, to shoot every ball but sometimes your body does things a little bit different.' Saric is having to log heavy minutes because the 76ers are only dressing 8-9 players lately, but his owners probably don't have to worry about any DNPs with the 76ers so banged up. Despite shooting just 5-of-18 on Wednesday, Saric has been a beast for his fantasy owners."
,"Brooks says Gortat 'needs to play better': 'Definitely needs to play better but weve got some options,' Brooks said. Those 'options' are Jason Smith, Ian Mahinmi and Markieff Morris, as the Wizards have been playing more small ball and Gortat has seen his minutes fall off since the All-Star break. In fact, he hasn't played in the fourth quarter of four straight games. He's slumping at the worst possible time for fantasy owners and is a drop candidate if there's a hot free agent available."
,"Paul George thinks Stephenson will help: 'We had a special memories,' George said. 'We've definitely got a bond on that court. Hopefully we pick up where we left off. Hes excited. Hes always considered Indiana home, so hes very excited to play with me and us again. This is where he made his name and made his mark. Hes got that in the back of his mind.' After signing a three-year, $12 million deal, Stephenson is expected to suit up for Sunday's game vs. LeBron James and the Cavaliers. You can't make this stuff up. Unless he blows us away and recaptures the form he once had in Indiana, leave him on the wire."
,"Reggie Evans targeting NBA return: The 36-year-old rebounding machine has the second-best career rebound percentage in league history. 'Im still working out and waiting on an opportunity to present itself,' Evans said. 'In the meantime, being home has provided me with more time to give back to the community.' Even if gets picked up, there's no fantasy appeal here."
,"Marshall Plumlee assigned to D-League: Even with the Knicks tanking, fantasy owners can safely leave Plumlee and Ndour on the waiver wire."
,"Dwyane Wade hoping to return for postseason: 'He got a really good sweat in [Wednesday],' coach Fred Hoiberg said. 'Just continue to try to increase his workload and hopefully he responds well. He just has a little bit of soreness and stiffness after [shooting], but they want him out there testing it. It's a work in progress.' With eight games remaining in the regular season, the Bulls trail both the No. 8 seed (Pacers) and No. 7 seed (Heat) by 1.5 games."
,"Carmelo 'at peace' with reduced role: 'I see the writing on the wall. I see what it is,' Anthony said. 'I see what they're trying to do, and it's just me accepting that. That's what puts me at peace. Just knowing and understanding how things work. I'm at peace with that.' The Knicks haven been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs and Melo's usage rate and minutes are both trending down, and with just seven games remaining on the schedule, the shutdown watch is on."
,"Buddy Hield shoots 1-of-7 in blowout defeat: The Kings won their previous two games but they were decimated tonight, falling into a 20-point hole after one quarter. Hield will be a focal point of the Kings' attack as they develop younger talent down the stretch, and he came in scoring double-digit points in 13 of his past 14 games. He should have extra motivation to score the ball vs. the Pelicans on Friday."
,"Georgios Papagiannis plays 20 minutes Wed: Dave Joerger described Monday's game as a 'last stand' for his team's veterans, so owners can expect plenty of DNPs in Sacramento's final seven games. As a 19-year-old lottery pick, Papagiannis figures to be one of the biggest winners, but the question is when Joerger will fully unleash his young guys. Again, there are only seven games left in the Kings' regular season."
,"Skal Labissiere plays 33 minutes as starter: Skal logged 33 minutes despite racking up five fouls, and owners in roto leagues won't appreciate his 1-of-4 mark at the free throw line. He's at 55.3 percent FGs and 71.4 percent FTs on the season, however, so efficiency hasn't been a recurring issue. The Kings are leaning into their youth movement, which means Labissiere and Georgios Papagiannis (20 minutes) should see their roles increasing down the stretch."
,"Tyreke Evans quiet in 25 minutes Wednesday: Evans sat out Monday's game and more DNPs are inevitable over the Kings' final seven games. They don't have any back-to-back sets until April 11/12, but there's no guarantee that Evans and other veterans won't be rested as a precaution before then. He's simply too unreliable to own outside of the deepest formats."
,"Rodney Hood hits 5-of-5 triples for 18 points: Hood had 20 points, six boards and three assists on Monday with Gordon Hayward (quad) in street clothes. His efficiency tonight is a welcome sight for fantasy owners, especially since both Hayward and Alec Burks (personal) were back in action. He's been banged up and erratic for most of the season, shooting 41.3 percent overall, so hopefully he can finish strong for a Jazz team that holds a 1.5-game lead on the Clippers for the No. 4 seed."
,"Alec Burks (personal) logs nine minutes Wed: Burks missed one game following the birth of his first child, and his return was welcome news for Utah's depleted backcourt. He's still not worth owning while Dante Exum, Shelvin Mack, Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, Joe Johnson and Joe Ingles are all healthy."
,"Dante Exum goes scoreless in 23 minutes: The Jazz were playing without George Hill (groin) and Raul Neto (groin), so it was all hands on deck at the point guard spot tonight. Exum was chewed out by coach Quin Snyder after some early mistakes, and he was outplayed by Shelvin Mack, so there's no clear incentive to add him at any depth."
,"Chris Paul scores 27 points, Clips score 133: The Clippers just smashed to match a season-high 133 points in this win. Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Paul and J.J. Redick reached the 20-point mark in the same game for the first time ever. CP3 appears to be out of his shooting slump and has now made 5-of-10 from deep in his last two, but there was never really much concern to begin with. Moving forward, the Clippers have a lot going on with playoff seeding, trailing the No. 4 seed Jazz by 1.5 games while holding a slim 1.0 lead over the Thunder. That should allow CP3 to log plenty of minutes in his team's final eight games."
,"Shelvin Mack looks good in 29 bench minutes: George Hill and Raul Neto were both out with groin injuries tonight, so Mack logged more playing time than he'd seen since early January. Groin injuries tend to linger but Hill and Neto are both day-to-day, so Mack is little more than a streaming option in deep leagues."
,"Blake Griffin scores 26 points in win vs. Wiz: The Clippers offense was on fire and Blake's bucket with 5:43 left in the third made the Clippers the fastest team to 100 points in a game this season -- Lawler's law worked again today. Griffin's numbers were trending down with only 17.7 points per game over his previous 10, which has knocked him down to just fifth-round value per game on the year. Hopefully, this big game gets him going again."
,"DeAndre Jordan cleans up against the Wizards: He has scored 20-plus points in consecutive games for the first time this season and the fourth time in his career. Jordan has also been cleaning up on the glass with double-digit boards in eight straight, and he's also up to 76.5 percent from the field in March for his 14.1 points per game this month."
,"J.J. Redick scores 31 points vs. Wizards: Nobody told the Wizards that Redick can shoot a little bit, and maybe they thought he wasn't playing despite his ankle injury from the weekend. Redick should also be a bigger part of the offense in the short term now that Austin Rivers (hamstring) is going to miss time. He was trending down, but now he's trending back up due to the Rivers injury."
,"Jamal Crawford scores 14 points: He should be getting closer to 30 minutes with Austin Rivers (hamstring) set to miss at least one game. Crawford could be a scoring specialist and gets a friendly matchup on Thursday against the Suns."
,"Austin Rivers (hamstring) out for Thursday: He has hamstring soreness and the Clippers won't need to rush him back now that J.J. Redick is healthy. Redick is coming off a season-high 31 points and should benefit the most until Rivers comes back. Jamal Crawford figures to pick up some minutes and perhaps Raymond Felton plays a little more SG."
,"Danny Green solid in tough loss to Warriors: Green logged 30 minutes tonight and the scoring was his highest total since late December -- he came in averaging a mere 6.6 points per game in March. He's a fine roto option thanks to reliable 3-pointers and defensive stats, but he's a tougher sell in most other formats."
,"Tony Parker scoreless in 24 minutes Wednesday: This was Parker's second scoreless game of the season, and it's the fourth time in seven games that he's scored four points or fewer. The veteran recently conceded that he's no longer needed to be aggressive offensively, and is instead looking to set up teammates, but he struggled in both of those aspects tonight. He faces another unique challenge vs. Russell Westbrook and the Thunder on Friday."
,"John Wall scores 41 points in loss to Clips: It's the most points he's scored on the road in his career, but the Wizards couldn't stop a nosebleed on defense during this loss. Wall's scoring is through the roof these days with at least 34 points in three straight while he's also seen 3.0 steals per game and plenty of other stats along the way. While the Wizards can't defend right now, Wall's fantasy owners have to be loving these high-scoring, fast-paced games."
,"Kawhi Leonard struggles in home loss to GSW: Kawhi noted after the game that defenses have been loading up against him with double-team coverage and extra help on pick-and-rolls. That's a natural step for one of the league's MVP candidates, and the hope is that he'll figure out how to get to his spots more quickly, while potentially getting more assists by finding open teammates. Tonight's line is an aberration, of course, due to the Warriors' elite switching defense."
,"LaMarcus Aldridge gets 17 & 6 w/ four blocks: San Antonio blew out the Cavs on Monday and they're a combined 4-1 vs. the Cavs and Warriors this season, with tonight's game as their only loss. The Spurs are now 3.5 games behind the Warriors with eight games left in the regular season, so veterans like Aldridge are prime suspects for precautionary DNPs down the stretch."
,"Marcin Gortat scores just six points: He didn't close out again and coach Scott Brooks just doesn't trust Gortat like he used to. Maybe it's because Gortat was playing too many minutes, but he's a drop candidate in most leagues right now."
,"Jason Smith scores 14 points: That puts him at 30 triples on the season, which is double his previous career high in a season. Smith did benefit late in this game from Markieff Morris getting ejected, so the playing time is slightly inflated. He's been in the mix and does play minutes in the teens most nights, but he's not someone fantasy owners should add here."
,"David West goes off vs. Spurs on Wednesday: 'I dont like to [rest players] but Im trying to get us ready for the playoffs, keep our guys fresh,' said coach Steve Kerr. 'If they need a rest, Ill do it.' West is 36 years old and could be a DNP-CD candidate down the stretch, but it really helps that he's averaged just 12.1 minutes this season. Despite his big game tonight, he's not a trustworthy fantasy asset."
,"Kelly Oubre scores 10 points: That's three very solid games for Oubre, averaging 13.3 points, 6.0 boards, 1.3 steals and 0.7 treys in those three. For fantasy, Oubre's strong play is more about how it's killing Bojan Bogdanovic's value than Oubre becoming an add. Oubre is better suited for deep leagues."
,"Bogie plays just 16 minutes: It's just not going well for him these days. The Wizards are struggling on defense and Kelly Oubre is playing the best basketball of his life, so Bogdanovic is a clear drop in most leagues."
,"Andre Iguodala excels again in win vs. Spurs: Golden State has won nine straight games and coach Steve Kerr singled out Iguodala as a reason for the success. 'Andres been our best player here the last few weeks,' Kerr said. 'Hes been fantastic. He looks incredibly athletic, bouncy, and fresh. Hes a pro. This guy just knows how to take care of his body. I think hes done a great job in stepping up in KDs absence and recognizing what we need from him  hes brilliant.' He's posting top-40 value in 9-cat leagues over the past two weeks, so his fantasy owners will echo that sentiment."
,"Anthony Davis scores 30 with 13 boards: He had two different trips to the locker room due to diving on the scorer's tables. He dinged up his chin from the incident, but it didn't affect him with Davis having a very high activity level. He's been racking up the stats and Davis is the first player since Shaquille O'Neal with four consecutive games of 30 points and 13 rebounds. As long as he's healthy, he's a monster."
,"Patrick McCaw nearly picks up DNP-CD: McCaw shot 0-of-12 during his last game vs. the Spurs, which may have weighed into coach Steve Kerr's thinking tonight. Matt Barnes was also a more natural choice to check Kawhi Leonard defensively. Even with Kevin Durant sidelined, McCaw has been too limited for fantasy use."
,"Matt Barnes solid in 26 minutes vs. Spurs: Barnes gave the Warriors a more experienced player to pit against Kawhi Leonard, who wound up shooting just 7-of-20 from the field, so it's safe to say the move paid off. Tonight's modest success aside, Barnes is very difficult to trust for fantasy purposes."
,"DeMarcus Cousins scores 29 points in win: His ankle sprain that cost him two games didn't seem to bother him too much while he was out there. Interestingly, Cousins wasn't out there for a handful of possessions in the clutch. Plus, coach Alvin Gentry was a bit perturbed by the lack of post touches for Cousins late in the fourth when he had major size advantage, so that was a factor. Cousins himself said the team was 'terrible' down the stretch, as well. All this said, Boogie looks good to go and the Pelicans still have a small chance for the playoffs. It's extremely unlikely, though."
,"Solomon Hill scores seven points: With Jrue Holiday, DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis just taking so many shots in the first unit, Hill won't have enough opportunity to produce on the stat sheet for fantasy owners. His foot injury didn't seem to bother him today."
,"Jordan Crawford scores 15 points: Whether you call him Steez or Instant Grits, Crawford has been getting it done lately. He's scored in double figures for six straight games with 2.3 treys per game in that span. He's still got some work to do to be anything more than a specialist, but give him a look if you need some scoring with a couple dimes thrown in there."
,"Dante Cunningham comes through off bench: That's a pretty good outing for Cunningham, but he's just too inconsistent to trust almost anywhere when the Pelicans are healthy."
,"James Ennis starts Wed for JaMychal Green: We've seen what Ennis can do as a starter, and it's not thrilling -- in 24 starts this season, he's averaged 8.5 points, 1.1 threes, 4.6 boards, 1.3 assists, 0.3 blocks and 1.3 assists. Green is just day-to-day with his shoulder injury, so there's no clear incentive to add Ennis in most situations."
,"Dirk Nowitzki scores 23 points vs. Pels: The Mavs really needed this one to make the postseason and now they're 5.5 behind the Blazers for the No. 8 seed with just eight games to play. Nowitzki's minutes have increased to 27.4 minutes per game since the break, so it'll be interesting to see how the Mavs play it once they are eliminated. Nowitzki's fantasy owners should still have him active, but keep an eye out for some planned rest."
,"Brandan Wright solid as fill-in starter: Marc Gasol's strained left foot cost him another game tonight, bumping Wright into the starting lineup, but it's unclear if Gasol will miss any more games. Head coach David Fizdale referred to it as a day-to-day issue, adding, 'I think its just swelling and soft-tissue type stuff ... Its nothing structural that we have to be totally concerned about.' Wright logged 28 minutes tonight and should see similar action if Gasol misses more games."
,"Zach Randolph posts all-around line off bench: Memphis was playing without both Marc Gasol (foot) and JaMychal Green (shoulder) tonight, and David Fizdale opted to mix things up -- Brandan Wright and James Ennis started, with Z-Bo anchoring the second unit. The Grizzlies snapped a four-game losing streak while improving to 2-4 without Marc Gasol this season, so it's reasonable to assume Randolph will come off the bench if Marc isn't ready to play this weekend."
,"Mike Conley scores 36 pts w/ seven 3-pointers: Memphis scored a season-high 38 points in the first quarter alone tonight, thanks largely to Conley's explosion, and his 16 points matched a career-high for a single quarter. He's the alpha and omega of the Grizzlies' offense with Marc Gasol (foot) out of commission, and owners can expect more big lines if Gasol can't suit up on Friday and Sunday."
,"Vince Carter scores 21 points in 33 minutes: In the process, Carter passed Ray Allen for 22nd in NBA history for career points -- next up is Patrick Ewing, who is 304 points ahead of the ageless VC. Chandler Parsons' season-ending knee surgery has vaulted Carter into a critical role for the playoff-hungry Grizzlies -- they're currently holding the No. 7 seed, which would likely mean a first-round matchup vs. the Spurs."
,"Paul George posts 28.6 percent usage rate: George lit into his teammates after Tuesday's loss to the Wolves, saying that his team had 'no sense of urgency, no winning pride.' He also stated bluntly, 'I don't think I got the ball enough down the stretch.' He finished with 28.6 percent usage tonight, and it would be surprising if he hits a lower mark than that over Indy's final seven games."
,"Aaron Brooks scores 18 points in 28 minutes: Indiana is tied with Miami for the No. 8 seed and  they're just 1.5 games up on the No. 9 seed Bulls, with road games looming vs. the Raptors and Cavaliers this weekend. Head coach Nate McMillan will roll with whichever lineups are working, in other words, and tonight that meant more Brooks over an ineffective Jeff Teague (20 minutes). That's extremely unlikely to become a trend."
,"Jeff Teague struggles in 20 minutes Wednesday: Mike Conley ran wild offensively to open the game and Teague seemed to shrink into himself after that onslaught -- he never found a rhythm offensively, and was outplayed by backup Aaron Brooks. As disappointing as this is for Teague's owners, he's still primed for a bounce-back effort vs. Cory Joseph and the Raptors on Friday."
,"Lance Stephenson gets DNP on Wednesday: Stephenson inked a three-year, $12 million deal earlier in the day, and he could be active in a critical game vs. Toronto on Friday. The Pacers are desperate to get more firepower in their beleaguered second unit, especially after waiving Rodney Stuckey due to his left knee injury, but nothing about Stephenson's recent play suggests he'll help fantasy owners."
,"Markieff Morris gets ejected on Wednesday: He went up for a block attempt on DeAndre Jordan and the refs called a foul on him, but he obviously didn't agree to lead to the ejection. He shouldn't be suspended for this infraction going forward. Morris finished with 14 points, four rebounds and two 3-pointers."
,"Monta Ellis very quiet as starter Wednesday: Ellis played 32 minutes but he posted a mere 10.0 percent usage rate -- the only player lower was Lavoy Allen (9.4 percent usage in 14 minutes). Pacers coach Nate McMillan wants Ellis to stay aggressive offensively with the starting unit, but recent returns haven't been good. Leave him on the wire in most formats."
,"Thaddeus Young posts double-double...finally: Al Jefferson (ankle) is out at least two weeks, and Glenn Robinson (calf) will miss at least one more week, so the Pacers need their key guys to be effective in big minutes. Young has struggled since he injured his left wrist -- he was 0-of-7 from the field on Sunday, but over the past two games he's a combined 15-of-27. This was his first double-double since late December."
,"Seth Curry scores 18 points vs. Pelicans: It was one of his better games as a point guard. At shootaround today, Curry said he likes playing on the ball more and wants to create for his teammates. He hasn't been much of a passer on the season with just 2.7 assists per game, but maybe he can get into the fours going forward. Curry also said he was playing through his shoulder since last week, so he may have to manage that injury going forward. Regardless, go ahead and start Curry in standard leagues."
,"Yogi Ferrell scores 15 points vs. NO: It was a huge game and the Mavs didn't play Seth Curry at straight one. He did get a slight bump from the Mavs losing Devin Harris in the first half, so the minutes are a little higher than expectations. Ferrell is still tough to add in most leagues."
,"P.J. Tucker heads to bench w/ Carroll active: Toronto has a vastly superior net rating (+12.6) with Tucker playing in the post-Lowry starting unit, compared to Carroll (-6.7), albeit in a small sample size. The two veteran forwards split their time tonight, with Carroll logging 25 minutes, and this looks like a no-win situation for fantasy purposes."
,"DeMarre Carroll (back) quiet in return Wed: Carroll has struggled with injuries and inconsistency all season, and there's no reason to think that will change in Toronto's final seven regular-season games. He's better in 9-cat leagues due to minimal turnovers, and is a decent source of 3-pointers with some defensive stats, but that's about it."
,"Jonas Valanciunas double-doubles vs. CHA: The Raptors' six-game win streak was snapped tonight, despite JV's big game. He helped get Cody Zeller into serious foul trouble, which left him in control of the paint, but it was perimeter defense that hurt Toronto tonight -- Charlotte went 16-of-32 from downtown. Valanciunas hasn't been the guy you wanted on draft day, but his value has stabilized in the late-round range."
,"Cory Joseph gets all-around gem in tough loss: Joseph dropped a personal-best 13 assists on Monday, as his team scored 131 points on 59.0 percent shooting, but even his terrific game tonight couldn't prevent a 110-106 home loss. The Raptors are 12-6 without Kyle Lowry, thanks largely to savvy trades, DeMar DeRozan's scoring, and Joseph's efforts as a fill-in starter. CoJo is red-hot, so you might as well keep him active."
,"Hassan Whiteside scores 11 points: He's talked about the pain in his hand from the stitches and his scoring is slightly down these days. He will get these Knicks again on Friday and he should have a better outing than this one. Whiteside also had some fun quotes about his team after the game. 'When the season started out, we were strangers. Strangers became friends, and then friends became family. These my guys,' Whiteside said. His Heat are now in the No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference."
,"Marco Belinelli goes off for 21 pts off bench: The veteran sharp-shooter had just one turnover in 27 minutes, and his efforts helped the Hornets escape with an essential road win in Toronto, keeping their slim playoff hopes alive. Frank Kaminsky added 13 points, three 3-pointers, four boards and two assists tonight, and those are the only two Hornets reserves worth considering in most fantasy leagues."
,"Cody Zeller fouls out scoreless in 27 minutes: Zeller grabbed six rebounds with four assists and one block, but overall it was a flop for fantasy purposes -- he's been on a steals binge lately, but didn't have any of those tonight, either. Zeller's been fabulous for the past few weeks, so most owners should simply shrug off this random dud."
,"Marvin Williams posts efficient double-double: Williams was coming off a poor game vs. the Bucks, but he compensated tonight with efficient 6-of-11 shooting and just one turnover in 35 minutes. The veteran has been a mediocre option on the season, due to a slow start, but over the past few weeks he's racking up top-50 roto value. He's been particularly good in 9-cat with an amazing two turnovers in his past 314 minutes of action."
,"Kemba Walker scores 19 points on 25 shots: Aided by a strong bench effort, the Hornets managed to hang on for a 110-106 victory, their fifth win in seven games. They haven't been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, but it wouldn't be a shock to see coach Steve Clifford give his veterans more rest if they drop a few games in the next week. That might not mean DNP-CDs, but even reduced playing time could have a major impact on fantasy matchups. We'll let you know if things start to trend in that direction."
,"Miles Plumlee solid in 15 minutes Wednesday: Plumlee was cleared to play last Friday but coach Steve Clifford hasn't felt the need to use him. He was effective in his limited action tonight, but that was largely due to Cody Zeller's foul trouble, so it's unclear if he'll carve out a niche going forward. Don't expect any fantasy value."
,"Austin Rivers (left hamstring) out for game: He went to the locker room in the second quarter and was ruled out approximately 15 minutes later. Thankfully, the Clippers do have J.J. Redick back for this game and Jamal Crawford can also help out. There should be slightly more Luc Mbah a Moute until Rivers can come back. Redick is the only guy worth owning in standard leagues."
,"James Johnson does his thing: He just does this far too often and probably deserves more love for Most Improved Player. Johnson and his black-belt game have been one of the best values in fantasy this year. Chalk up another gem to coach Erik Spoelstra."
,"Josh Richardson drops 17 points with 5 steals: There he is. Richardson has been knocking on the door for a big game and it finally came together. His averages over his last five do look pretty good, posting 12.2 points, 2.2 boards, 3.0 assists, 1.4 blocks, 1.6 steals and 1.6 treys. He should be owned in all leagues going forward."
,"Marcus Smart posts 11/11/5 & defensive stats: Smart loves to launch end-of-quarter shots with zero chance of making them, the sort of stats-be-damned mentality that is great in real life, but only hurts his already poor percentages in fantasy. Owners know what their getting at this point, and we can only hope that he devotes his offseason to fixing his jumper."
,"Jonas Jerebko (knee) scoreless in four mins: Jerebko has fallen out of the rotation for stretches, and even when he's playing he rarely gets more than 14-18 minutes. With the Celtics frontcourt at full strength, there's no reason to touch him in fantasy leagues."
,"Isaiah Thomas scores 32 points w/ full line: Thomas didn't mince words when asked how Boston has been able to seize the No. 1 seed in the East. 'Because were good. Like, were really good,' Thomas said. 'We know how to play with each other and guys are unselfish and know their roles.' IT4 certainly knows his role, as he leads the Celtics in scoring virtually every game, while functioning as one of the league's premier fourth-quarter closers. He's hit at least one 3-pointer in 50 straight games and is now the franchise leader in 3-pointers during a single season, overtaking Antoine Walker. Win or lose, he's a fantasy stud."
,"Jae Crowder struggles vs. MIL on Wednesday: Crowder shot just 4-of-12 from the field and he committed four turnovers, his highest total since Feb. 2016. His shots have been falling lately, after a prolonged slump, so owners should expect a far more efficient outing vs. Orlando's defense on Friday."
,"Malcolm Brogdon helps lift Bucks past Celtics: Brogdon shot 3-of-3 from the field with two assists in the final 2:25 tonight, and he earned praise from opposing coach Brad Stevens after the game. 'I have a lot of respect for Brogdon,' Stevens said. 'He's tough.' Milwaukee did well to snag him in the second round of the draft, and the 24-year-old has instantly contributed to the success of both the Bucks and his fantasy owners."
,"KP scores 20 points vs. Heat: With the Knicks eliminated from the postseason and Carmelo Anthony saying he doesn't know what his role is, we might see some changes to the Knicks on offense. Porzingis could be going either way because he does have some Achilles injuries this season while he could be very busy if the Knicks shut Melo down. His fantasy owners should keep rolling him out there until further notice."
,"Khris Middleton breaks out of slump Wednesday: Middleton came in shooting a combined 11-of-42 shooting in his past three games (26.2 percent), so this was a welcome change of pace. Milwaukee is in a virtual tie with the Hawks for the No. 5 seed, and just two games separate them from the No. 9 seed Bulls. They're playing for their postseason lives, in other words, so key guys like Middleton shouldn't have to worry about DNPs or rest down the stretch."
,"Tony Snell flops after his career-best game: Snell scored a career-high 26 points vs. Charlotte on Tuesday, and this was the opposite end of the spectrum from the typically subdued swingman. He's not the worst option as a source of 3-pointers and steals, but Tuesday's game was an obvious fluke."
,"Giannis Antetokounmpo does it all in road win: Giannis finished 8-of-17 from the field, and the only area in which he wasn't dominant was free throw shooting -- he went 4-of-7 from the stripe. He earned well-deserved praise from Celtics coach Brad Stevens before the game. 'I don't know if I've ever seen anybody like him [in transition],' Stevens said. 'Obviously, LeBron is the guy you would compare [him] to with the size, the length, the speed, the ability to change direction and finish.' As a reminder, he's still just 22 years old."
,"Willy scores 12 with nine boards: The Knicks should be sticking with Hernangomez in the starting lineup the rest of the way. Hernangomez has fared well in his last five, averaging 14.0 points, 9.2 boards, 1.4 assists and 0.8 steals. He should be owned in all leagues and could trend up even more."
,"Carmelo Anthony sees a drop in usage again: That's good for just a 21.5 usage rate and that continues to be a trend. Melo's usage rate has consistently been in the low-to-mid 20s these days and only has a 24.4 usage rate in his last 10 games. Anthony had a 29.7 usage rate before the break, so it's a sharp decline there.  Interestingly, Melo had some strange comments after the game. 'I dont even know my role,' Anthony said. 'I dont know my role to be honest...I get in where I fit in.' Shutdown watch is on."
,"Elfrid Payton gets 11/8/6 in inefficient line: Frank Vogel stressed defense as the reason for Monday's loss to Toronto. 'We had breakdowns across the board with transition, with finding their shooters,' Vogel said. 'Containment issues, again.' That's a recipe for disaster vs. a penetrator as good as Russell Westbrook, and sure enough he detonated for a 57/13/11 triple-double to steal a road win vs. Orlando tonight. The Magic have a lot to ponder this offseason."
,"Terrence Ross scores 23 points w/ five 3s: The efficiency, 3-pointers and defensive stats combine to make this one of T-Ross' best lines of the season, and he logged 45 minutes in an eventual overtime defeat. Aaron Gordon chipped in 13 points, five boards and four steals, and Nikola Vucevic had 11 points, 16 boards and two blocks, but it wasn't enough to beat the one-man wrecking-crew named Russell Westbrook."
,"Mario Hezonja logs 18 minutes off bench Wed: Jeff Green's back spasms sidelined him again tonight and Hezonja continues to pick up extra minutes with the veteran sidelined. He's yet to provide any reliable fantasy value, however, so the vast majority of owners can leave him on the wire."
,"Evan Fournier posts 24/6/5 in overtime loss: Fournier was tolerably efficient, hitting 9-of-22 FGs and 3-of-3 FTs with a 3-of-8 mark from downtown. He did commit five turnovers, but this is basically what owners have come to expect -- solid scoring, 3-pointers and FT percentages, with limited supporting stats."
,"Chasson Randle scores nine points: The Knicks actually used Randle quite a bit next to Ron Baker, but it could have been about the matchup against a smaller Miami backcourt. Randle does have more upside than Baker, so maybe he can have value if the Knicks want to shut down Derrick Rose (knee). For what it's worth, Rose is hoping to play on Friday."
,"Victor Oladipo quiet in game at Orlando: Oladipo didn't show much emotion when asked about playing the Magic. 'It's another road game for us,' he said. 'The ups and downs [in Orlando], changing positions, all in the long run benefited me  I have no regrets. I'm thankful for those three years.' He's probably also thankful to be playing on a team bound for the postseason, while the Magic are scuffling along with a 27-48 record."
,"Ron Baker scores six points: Derrick Rose (knee) has some soreness, but the Knicks are hoping to see him play on Friday. Of course, things could change now that they're eliminated from the postseason. Baker doesn't really have enough upside to stash regardless."
,"Russell Westbrook piles up 57/13/11 in OT win: Westbrook led a furious charge to send this game into OT, capped by a clutch 3-pointer against two defenders to tie the game (see the link below). This was the highest-scoring game ever with a triple-double and Westy now has 38 of them on the year, three behind Oscar Robertson's single-season record. Magic swingman Evan Fournier advocated Westbrook as a 'co-MVP' with James Harden before the game, and fantasy owners will also be hard-pressed to make a distinction between those two studs."
,"Collison, Hield, Evans, Skal, WCS starting: With Kosta Koufos resting again, the Kings will go back to Skal here. The rookie has been a disaster in a past handful of games, but now he gets a tough matchup against the Jazz."
,"Tiago Splitter gets DNP-CD vs. Atlanta: Splitter admitted that he was 'a little bit [nervous]' in his return on Tuesday, but the bigger issue is rust -- he sat for over a year, and the Sixers are going to take it very slow. Tonight's DNP-CD wasn't surprising, coming in the second half of back-to-back set, and Splitter won't be helping fantasy owners this year."
,"Gerald Henderson (sore hip) returns Wednesday: Henderson's shot wasn't falling tonight, as he went just 2-of-10 from the field with one 3-pointer, and he also turned the ball over three times. The Sixers had nine players on their active roster tonight and Henderson is the rare veteran to stick in the rotation on a young, rebuilding team, but he's still not a fantasy asset."
,"Justin Anderson logs 25 minutes as starter: Covington's return date is unclear, which could thrust Anderson in the fantasy picture, but it's hard to trust him in standard leagues. In addition to uncertain playing time, he's shooting a combined 12-of-41 in his past six games (29.3 percent). This was at least a step in the right direction."
,"Richaun Holmes scores 25 pts on 11-of-16 FGs: Holmes even went 2-of-2 from the line with just one turnover in 32 minutes, rounding out a very strong line vs. Dwight Howard and the Hawks. He made all of his attempts from within 10 feet tonight, and is a terrific fantasy option with Jahlil Okafor (knee) is sidelined."
,"Shawn Long quiet in 16 minutes Wednesday: Long made 4-of-5 field goals with two 3-pointers, but the peripheral stats and minutes just weren't there tonight. Richaun Holmes erupted for 25 points on 11-of-16 shooting, which didn't help, but Long has now posted two straight duds after a hot stretch from Mar. 22-26. He's too mercurial to trust in most leagues."
,"Dennis Schroder commits nine turnovers vs PHI: It wasn't a total loss, as he chipped in five assists, three rebounds and one steal, but owners in 9-cat leagues can't be happy -- he's now averaging 6.8 turnovers in his past five games. He's also shooting below 41 percent from the field in that span, which takes the shine off his otherwise robust statistics."
,"Dwight Howard posts 22 & 20 in win at Philly: Dwight has eight consecutive double-doubles and he's up to 50 on the season. He's quietly out-performed his Average Draft Position in the vast majority of formats, and should continue to do so with Atlanta trying to hold onto the No. 5 seed."
,"Ersan Ilyasova scores 14 points vs. Sixers: Ilyasova played 32 minutes and should continue to get elevated playing time with Paul Millsap (knee) out at least two more games. He was coming off a strong double-double and played well against vs. his former team tonight, and his rebounds would have been higher if Dwight Howard hadn't dominated with 20 boards."
,"Taurean Prince logs 35 minutes as starter: Thabo Sefolosha (groin) and Mike Dunleavy (ankle) were out again tonight. Kent Bazemore (knee) returned to action but it was Prince earning another start, as coach Mike Budenholzer clearly trusts his rookie forward to learn on the job. His ability to chip in 3-pointers and defensive stats helps to support him as a standard-league roto option, but he's less appealing in points leagues and DFS."
,"Kent Bazemore (knee) thrives in return on Wed: Bazemore's return was welcome news for a Hawks team that's missing Paul Millsap (knee), Thabo Sefolosha (groin) and Mike Dunleavy (ankle). He was particularly effective from deep, shooting 4-of-5 from that range, and looked rejuvenated after sitting out the past five games. His minutes should ramp up quickly, so don't hesitate to grab him if you have a guy you're looking to cut."
,"Andrew Harrison (ankle) doubtful to return: The Grizzlies are going to be a little thin tonight and will be giving a few extra minutes to Troy Daniels. If Harrison needs to miss time, they might get Wade Baldwin in the rotation again. There's little fantasy value changing here."
,"Patrick McCaw off bench w/ Barnes starting: McCaw hasn't played more than 16 minutes in his past three games, and he's averaging 2.3 points in that span, so this move shouldn't impact many fantasy owners."
,"Matt Barnes starting; Pat McCaw to bench: The Warriors will go away from McCaw after his 0-of-12 against the Spurs in the last game against them back on Mar. 11. Barnes figures to play minutes in the 20s, but he's not really a fantasy option."
,"Dante Exum starting at PG for Jazz Wednesday: Shelvin Mack should also get plenty of minutes tonight with Utah thin in the backcourt, with Gordon Hayward also earning extra ball-handling duties. Exum is only worth a glance for short-term value."
,"Gordon Hayward will play; Exum starting: He's back after missing just one game due to a knee to his quad from Austin Rivers. Hayward went through shootaround today and he did try to play through the injury initially, so Hayward should be close to 100 percent. His return should take minutes from Joe Ingles, Joe Johnson and maybe even Rodney Hood."
,"Ty Lawson (quad) probable Wednesday vs. Jazz: The Kings are leaning into their youth movement and it's impossible to rely on Lawson down the stretch, but at least he might give deep-league owners something tonight."
,"J.J. Redick (ankle) will play against Wizards: He's back after missing one game. Redick landed on a basketball to turn his ankle and it didn't look too bad on Saturday, so expect Redick to be somewhat close to 100 percent. He's still only a borderline asset in fantasy while Austin Rivers loses value here."
,"Devin Harris ejected in first half vs. Pels: He was ejected with nine minutes left in the first half for arguing with the ref. Harris probably won't be suspended for this, finishing with two points in six minutes. We should see slightly more J.J. Barea and Dorian Finney-Smith tonight."
,"Anthony Davis back after trip to locker room: He dove into the scorers table with Dante Cunningham, but he did return to the bench a few minutes later, and has since returned. It looks like Davis is OK."
,"Kevin Durant already taking on contact: He played full-court and half-court 1-on-1, so this is a great sign to see him taking on contact already. Durant was expected to take on contact at some point in the next 7-10 days, and coach Steve Kerr also said he would like to see KD get back out there for some regular-season action. For now, Apr. 8 seems like a possibility for the former MVP."
,"James Michael McAdoo available to play: He might get out there if the game turns into a blowout."
,"Kevon Looney (left hip strain) out Wednesday: Nothing to see here as the Dubs are at full strength and Looney rarely exceeds the five-minute mark when healthy."
,"James Ennis starting Wednesday vs. Pacers: Ennis joins a starting lineup that includes Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Vince Carter and Brandan Wright. He's an interesting streaming play but isn't a great add in most situations with JaMychal Green (shoulder) day-to-day."
,"Brandan Wright starting; Randolph to bench: The Grizzlies need some scoring in their second unit, so they'll have their 22nd different starting lineup today. Wright should be looking at minutes in the 20s and is a viable play in fantasy. He will only have short-term value until Marc Gasol (foot) can return."
,"Zach Randolph to bench, B-Wright starting: Randolph should still see plenty of minutes in the absence of both Marc Gasol (foot) and JaMychal Green (shoulder), so this doesn't do much to impact his fantasy value. He'll be the go-to option offensively for the Grizzlies' thin second unit."
,"Khris Middleton (head) will play on Wednesday: Middleton required three stitches to close a gash in his forehead on Tuesday, but he was never expected to spend any time on the sidelines. Malcolm Brogdon, Tony Snell, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Thon Maker will join him in the starting five for tonight's game."
,"Seth Curry (shoulder) will play on Wednesday: He was a full participant during shootaround and is no longer feeling any pain in his left shoulder, so he should be back in the starting five without a minutes restriction tonight. With Curry back in action, Yogi Ferrell will likely head back to the second unit and J.J. Barea won't play as much. Feel free to get Curry active for what should be an uptempo game against New Orleans."
,"Ron Baker will start Wednesday vs. the Heat: Joining Baker in the starting five for tonight's game will be Courtney Lee, Carmelo Anthony, Kristaps Porzingis and Willy Hernangomez. Baker really hasn't done much in his previous five starts this season, owning meager averages of 3.6 points, 1.6 dimes, 1.2 steals and 1.2 turnovers per game on 30.4 percent shooting, so he's not a very attractive option tonight with nine other games on the slate."
,"Carmelo Anthony listed as the starter: With Derrick Rose (knee) out, Melo should be looking at quite a few shots tonight. He'll likely get a couple nights off in the near future, but go ahead and get him in your lineup for now."
,"Taurean Prince will start again on Wednesday: Kent Bazemore (knee) will be back in action tonight, but Mike Budenholzer will go with the same starting five from over the past few games of Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., Prince, Ersan Ilyasova and Dwight Howard. Prince has excelled in his previous two starts, and he should be able to keep the good times rolling with an extremely favorable matchup against Philly tonight. Feel free to get him active."
,"Salah Mejri (knee) will not play vs. Pels: The team is calling it knee soreness, but it sounds like he got banged up on the play against the Thunder when he took that kick to the stomach. With Mejri out, we should get Dwight Powell back in the rotation and get minutes in the teens."
,"Dante Cunningham will return to the bench: DeMarcus Cousins (ankle) will be back in the starting lineup tonight following a two-game stint on the sidelines, so Cunningham will go from irrelevant starter to even more irrelevant bench player. Leave him on the wire."
,"Solo Hill is good to go for Wednesday: He was questionable to play with this foot injury. With DeMarcus Cousins (ankle) back in action, there likely won't be enough shots to go around for a guy like Hill to have fantasy value."
,"DeMarcus Cousins, Hill will play Wednesday: Cousins will be returning from a two-game absence, which will shift Dante Cunningham back to the second unit, and both Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday's usage rates will take a hit. Feel free to get Boogie active for a favorable matchup with the Mavericks."
,"P.J. Tucker will come off the bench: He has been a revelation on the defensive end and his ability to defender fours and larger threes has helped turn the Toronto defense around. With DeMarre Carroll (back) returning, Tucker loses a lot of his fantasy appeal."
,"Kyle Lowry (wrist) shooting with right hand: In an ideal scenario, Lowry will be able to get back to the court for the final 4-5 games of the year, but he remains without an official timetable, and you can bet the Raptors will be extremely cautious with bringing him back. With such little information, Lowry makes for an unattractive stash in most settings."
,"DeMarre Carroll will start, Tucker to bench: Carroll is back after missing his last two games. He was only playing around 20 minutes before his injury, so he should be in that neighborhood. With his return, Tucker, Norman Powell, Delon Wright, Jonas Valanciunas and Jakob Poeltl could lose a few minutes with the rotation change. Leave Carroll on the wire in most cases."
,"Marco Belinelli will be available vs. Raptors: He received seven stitches for the cut on his face and it sounds like he won't be limited. Belinelli's status means Jeremy Lamb likely won't be playing much while this also lowers the floor slightly for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist."
,"Jarell Eddie getting a second 10-day deal: Reading between the lines on this, there's a chance Devin Booker (ankle) could miss more games. The Suns are just 0.5 games 'behind' the Lakers for the No. 2 spot in the lottery, so losing is important. Eddie can stay on the wire just about everywhere."
,"Jonas Jerebko (knee) available to play Weds: Jerebko will resume his limited bench role with Boston at full strength, meaning he's not going to be earning enough minutes tonight to matter in any setting."
,"Lance Thomas (hip) out Wednesday vs. Miami: Wednesday will mark his fourth straight game on the sidelines, and it's unclear exactly when he'll be able to return to the court. Kristaps Porzingis, Willy Hernangomez and Kyle O'Quinn will continue to split Thomas' minutes, and Thomas can safely be left on the waiver wire in all settings."
,"Ty Lawson (quad) questionable for Wednesday: If Lawson is out, that will leave just Darren Collison, Langston Galloway, Buddy Hield and Ben McLemore as the only available players in Sacramento's backcourt. Hield has been playing very well as of late, although with 10 games on a slate and a tough matchup vs. the Jazz, he's not necessarily a must-start guy. Lawson has been hit-or-miss this season, but typically when Collison and Tyreke Evans are active, it's a miss."
,"Derrick Rose (sore left knee) will not play: This is not the same injury as his sore foot from over the weekend and Rose has a litany of knee injuries, so this could be a multiple-game absence. He'll be too risky to own in fantasy the rest of the way. We'll see plenty of Ron Baker in the starting lineup while Chasson Randle backs him up. Neither are great fantasy options. <br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> With Rose and Thomas off the floor this season, Carmelo Anthony leads the Knicks with a 37.9% usage rate, a massive 6.7% bump from his season total. There has been some talk about the Knicks easing up on Melo down the stretch run, but he appears to be a full go this evening. We should also see Ron Baker pick up extra court time, although he's not all that appealing with Melo and Porzingis still active."
,"Garrett Temple will not play: There should be a heavy dose of Buddy Hield with Temple out for today. Tyreke Evans and Langston Galloway should get minutes, as well."
,"Kosta Koufos, Garrett Temple will not play: This is a standard move for the Kings. They have rested him basically every other game and started him in the other. We'll see some Georgios Papagiannis tonight after a DNP-CD on Monday."
,"Afflalo, Koufos, Temple out vs. the Jazz: Afflalo has spent the past two games away from the team for personal reasons, and with both him and Temple on the sidelines tonight, Buddy Hield and Darren Collison will get all the run they can handle as some of the last men standing in Sacramento's backcourt. Afflalo isn't really worth owning anywhere."
,"Kent Bazemore will come off the bench: It will be his first game back after missing the last five. Mike Dunleavy (knee) is out, so perhaps Bazemore just slides right into his 18-minute role from Tuesday night. Taurean Prince should still be looking at a decent amount of playing time and is the preferred fantasy option for now."
,"Brandon Ingram (knee) questionable Thursday: While he's being listed as questionable, Luke Walton said he doesn't anticipate Ingram taking the court after he was unable to get through Wednesday's practice in full. It's looking like Corey Brewer will be earning another start on Thursday night, and it'll be David Nwaba and Larry Nance splitting the majority of Ingram's minutes."
,"Gerald Henderson back for Wednesday: He'll be coming off the bench and the 76ers should take a long look at Justin Anderson in the starting lineup. Henderson isn't worth owning as the 76ers may look at their young guys more than they have before this point."
,"Justin Anderson making first start as 76er: He finally gets his chance to start and he should be looking at huge minutes. The 76ers will have to play Nik Stauskas at the one to open up some wing minutes and coach Brett Brown may even need Anderson to play minutes at the four. Anderson is coming off a 4-of-14 from the field outing against the Nets on Tuesday, so there should be a lot of usage with minutes around 30. If you're in a competitive league, it makes sense to add JA speculatively until Covington is back."
,"Tiago Splitter (calf) probable for Wednesday: Splitter logged seven minutes in his 76ers' debut on Tuesday, so he'll likely be in that range again tonight as he splits backup center duties with Shawn Long. Splitter is not a viable target anywhere."
,"Robert Covington (knee) will not play vs. ATL: He had an MRI on his right knee and the results have not been revealed yet. This could be related to the right knee injury from Mar. 10, which caused him to miss one game. With the 76ers looking for lottery balls, it's possible they are very careful with RoCo. Justin Anderson gets a massive boost here and is worth a pickup for owners looking to add some up-and-coming wings. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot should also benefit and Shawn Long also should step up because the 76ers can't use Dario Saric as a five man as often."
,"Jahlil Okafor (knee) out Wednesday vs. ATL: This will be his fourth consecutive game watching from the sidelines, and it's starting to look like Okafor could start trending in shutdown territory, particularly with how well Richaun Holmes has played in his absence. Okafor's upside isn't great, so if you're in a standard league without an IR-spot, there's not much incentive to hang onto him."
,"Joe Harris out again: There hasn't been much info on Harris and he could be out for the season."
,"Quincy Acy will not play on Thursday: The Nets will hold him out in a non-back-to-back game, so it's possible he misses additional time. With him out, Justin Hamilton should get most of the backup minutes at the five."
,"Alec Burks back with the team: After being away from the team on Monday to be there for the birth of his daughter, Burks should be in the rotation tonight. He was playing point guard earlier in 2017 and the Jazz could look at him in that spot today. It'll still be tough to trust him in fantasy, especially if Gordon Hayward (quad) is a go."
,"Kevin Durant to be re-evaluated in 7-10 days: ESPN's Marc Stein adds a report that KD's comeback window is for the final three home games from Apr. 8 to Apr. 12. According to the team, Durant has been doing some running, shooting and jumping with the plan to intensify his level of movement over the next several days. He is expected to have a return to contact in practice once he's progressed to more high-intensity workouts. The team adds 'the end of the regular season remains a possibility' for KD to make his return. All this stuff said, Durant could make his return late next week, but he will likely have a limitation upon his return. He'll be tough to stash unless you can afford to wait until at least Apr. 8 against the Pelicans and possibly later than that."
,"Gordon Hayward (leg) goes through shootaround: This is a good sign for Hayward to suit up in the road game with a late tip. Hayward did take a knee to his lower quad on Saturday and it kept him out of action on Monday. If he can go, Hayward should be busy with George Hill (groin) out based on a 3.0 usage rate increase while also turning in a higher assist percentage. If things change and he can't go, Joe Ingles, Rodney Hood and Joe Johnson will have to carry the load on the wings.<br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> It's sounding like Hayward is going to give it a go tonight, especially considering the Jazz will be without George Hill. Hayward gets a modest usage bump with Hill, Favors and Neto off the floor this season (1.3%), with Rodney Hood getting the biggest bump among the Utah regulars (2.9%). Hood's playing time has been fairly erratic of late, but if he sees 25-30 minutes against the Kings, he'll have a nice shot at returning value."
,"Raul Neto out for Wednesday night: He suffered the injury on Monday during his 18 minutes against the Pelicans. With him and George Hill (groin) out, Dante Exum and Shelvin Mack figure to split the minutes at the point. Most fantasy owners may want to steer clear here on a 10-game night."
,"George Hill, Raul Neto will not play vs. SAC: Hill looked like he may have suffered this injury on Saturday, and he suffered another groin injury on Monday, as well. He has been a very slow healer and he's had groin injuries before, so the Jazz could take it easy on him until he's 100 percent. His fantasy owners may have to weigh their options on dropping him. With Hill and Neto out, Dante Exum and Shelvin Mack should be splitting the minutes at the point while Joe Ingles could be more of a primary ball handler. If Gordon Hayward can't go, there may be enough shots to go around for Exum to shoot the ball enough to use in DFS. He's a risky option, of course."
,"Iman Shumpert likely to play vs. Bulls: He went through a full practice on Wednesday with no issues, so he should be all set. With all of their losses lately, the Cavs could use him because J.R. Smith has not had much success in the starting lineup. Shumpert has missed his last two games and was playing minutes in the low 20s before his injury, so he's not really someone fantasy owners should add here."
,"James Michael McAdoo probable Wedsnesday: Steve Kerr said that he won't be resting any of his stars for Wednesday's game, so McAdoo's playing status is more or less irrelevant in fantasy hoops."
,"Dwyane Wade (elbow) doing light shooting: To be clear, Wade is done for the regular-season, so he can safely remain on the waiver wire in all re-draft formats. There is, however, a slim chance that Wade may be able to return at some point during the playoffs should the Bulls make the postseason, but with the way things have been going for Chicago this year, them squeaking their way into the playoffs seems like an unlikely scenario."
,"Cristiano Felicio (tailbone) a GTD Thursday: Felicio has spent the past three games on the sidelines, but it's looking like he could be back on the court on Thursday night. If he is able to return to action, he'll siphon away some minutes from Joffrey Lauvergne."
,"JaMychal Green (shoulder) questionable Weds: With Marc Gasol (foot) already having been ruled out for tonight's game, the Grizzlies will be thin up front if Green joins him on the sidelines. Brandan Wright or James Ennis would likely get the start sans Green, and rookie Deyonta Davis may be able to work his way into the rotation. Check back for another update closer to tip-off."
,"Mike Dunleavy (ankle) will not play vs. 76ers: Dunleavy just can't shake this ankle injury, but with Kent Bazemore (knee) set to get back on the court tonight, Dunleavy's absence will have a minimal impact in fantasy hoops. Leave him on the wire."
,"Solomon Hill (foot) questionable Wednesday: This is the first we're hearing of a foot issue for Hill, and if both he and DeMarcus Cousins (ankle) can't give it a go tonight, Alvin Gentry will need to get creative with his rotations. It's possible that Dante Cunningham could move to the three, with Domantas Motiejunas starting at the four and Anthony Davis at the five, and if that's the situation that plays out, Motiejunas may be someone to consider as a deep league streamer or DFS punt play. Stay tuned."
,"Kent Bazemore (knee) probable for Wednesday: Bazemore has spent the past five games on the sidelines, but he said on Tuesday that he was planning to return to the court tonight, and at this point, it would be surprising if he didn't play. That being said, he wasn't playing very well prior to going down, owning averages of just 12.4 points, 1.3 triples and 1.5 dimes per contest on 44.3 percent shooting, so he's basically just a low-end pickup in deep leagues. Tim Hardaway Jr. may be heading back to the bench tonight."
,"Thabo Sefolosha (groin) out Wednesday vs. PHI: Sefolosha was doubtful heading into this one, so him getting ruled out is far from surprising. Expect Kent Bazemore (knee) and Taurean Prince to split most of Sefolosha's minutes tonight. The Hawks don't play again until Saturday vs. Chicago, so maybe Sefolosha will be able to get back for that one after spending three games on the sidelines."
,"Report: IND inks Stephenson to 3-year deal: First off, wow. On the open market this season, Stephenson was only able to snag a non-guaranteed deal for $1.2 million from New Orleans, and a few 10-day contracts from Minnesota, so there really wasn't much reason for Bird to throw this sort of money at Born Ready. The first two years of this contract will reportedly be fully guaranteed with Year-3 being a team option. Stephenson put up career numbers the last time he was in Indy, but with how awful he's been over the past three years, fantasy GMs in most settings can use a wait-and-see approach."
,"Cameron Payne recalled from the D-League: Unfortunately, the move to Chicago did nothing to bolster Payne's fantasy value. Leave him on the wire."
,"Seth Curry (shoulder) plans to play vs. NO: It looks like the shoulder issue will only end up costing Curry one game on the sidelines, and if he is indeed able to get back to the court tonight, Yogi Ferrell will return to the bench and J.J. Barea's playing time could be confined to the teens. Check back for official confirmation on Curry's status closer to tip-off."
,"Marc Gasol (foot) will not play Wednesday: This will mark Gasol's third straight game on the sidelines, and with just two games remaining on the schedule for Memphis this week, owners in head-to-head leagues without an IR-spot fighting to advance to the next round may need to seriously consider cutting the three-time All-Star. Zach Randolph should be looking at another start tonight, and Mike Conley will be tasked with the heavy lifting on offense."
,"Report: IND looking to bring back Stephenson: Indiana opened up a roster spot by waiving Rodney Stuckey on Wednesday, so it appears that three years after Born Ready declined a five-year, $44 million deal from the Pacers, Larry Bird will be able to get him on the books for the veteran's minimum. While Stephenson did have a nice season the last time he put on a Pacers' jersey in 2013, he's been dreadful for the past three years, so this is wait-and-see territory just about everywhere."
,"Joakim Noah will begin serving suspension Wed: He's been medically cleared by an independent doctor, but with just eight games remaining on the schedule this year, Noah will need to spend an additional 12 games on the sidelines during the 2017-18 season. Phil Jackson took a risk on Noah by signing him to a four-year deal worth $72 million this past offseason, which was a pretty obvious swing and a miss. The 32-year-old won't be worth drafting in most leagues next season."
,"Marc Gasol (foot) questionable Wednesday: Gasol has spent the past two games on the sidelines with this foot issue, and if he's again forced to the sidelines tonight, Zach Randolph will likely earn another start with Mike Conley doing the heavy lifting on offense. After Wednesday, Memphis will only have two more games on the schedule this week, so owners in head-to-head leagues fighting to advance in the fantasy playoffs may need to seriously consider moving on from Gasol. Stay tuned."
,"DeMarre Carroll will try to play Wednesday: Dwane Casey confirmed that if Carroll is able to give it a go tonight, he'll reclaim his spot in the starting five, which will result in P.J. Tucker returning to the second unit. Carroll has been woefully inconsistent this season, so even if he is able to get out there, he can be left on the waiver wire in standard leagues."
,"Manny Harris will not be retained by Dallas: Harris' second 10-day contract has expired, so he's headed back to the D-League. Leave him on the wire."
,"DAL will ink Jarrod Uthoff for rest-of-season: Over the course of two 10-day contracts, Uthoff only managed to get on the court for a total of five minutes, missing his only shot attempt while recording one rebound, one block and two fouls. Clearly, he has no fantasy value anywhere."
,"Guerschon Yabusele joins the Main Red Claws: Yabusele came back stateside on March 16 after wrapping up his season in the CBA where he compiled averages of 20.9 points and 9.4 rebounds, but it took him a while to get his US work visa approved. There's a chance he could be suiting up for the Red Claws on Friday, but it's extremely unlikely he'll make a meaningful impact with the Celtics this season."
,"Report: Indiana will waive Rodney Stuckey: Stuckey will be injured throughout the postseason, and the Pacers need healthy bodies for a playoff run, so Stuckey gets the ax after only managing to suit up for 39 games for the Pacers this season. Additionally, with Indiana getting him off the books prior to April 10, Stuckey will no longer have a player option of $7 million for next season, so he'll need to find his next contract via free agency."
,"Whiteside still experiencing pain in hand: 'It's a little less pain, but it's still pain,' he said of his healing process, 'like if I shoot a lot of jump shots or if I do a lot, because it just bends back your hand. So that's what it is now.' Whiteside has been fighting through the pain over his past three games, and while his shot blocking numbers have dipped to 1.3 during that span, he's still been taking care of business with 17.3 points and 12.7 boards a night. He's obviously a must-start guy every time he steps on the court."
,"Brandon Ingram is not a shutdown candidate: Walton wants Ingram to get through a practice before he returns to the court, so we should have a better idea on his status for Thursday's game based on his activity during Wednesday's practice. That being said, despite earning 36 minutes a night over the past month, Ingram has ranked well outside the top-150 with averages of 13.0 points, 4.2 boards, 2.4 dimes, 1.0 steal and 2.3 turnovers per game, so there's not much incentive to hang onto him through the injury in most leagues."
,"Khris Middleton gets 3 stitches to forehead: Middleton was still able to log 35 minutes on Tuesday, and it doesn't sound like he's in jeopardy of missing Wednesday's game vs. Boston. Owners can expect official confirmation on his status closer to tip-off."
,"James Harden acknowledges wrist is hurting: 'It's pretty tough, man, I'm not going to lie,' said Harden of fighting through the pain with his wrist. 'I don't like to feel sorry for myself at all, but just the shot is short and frustrating when you can't really follow through and whatnot. I'm going to continue to go out there and do my best.' While Harden has made it clear he has no interest of getting hit with a rest day, it's Mike D'Antoni who will ultimately be able to decide if he plays Thursday vs. Portland. Check back for another update following Thursday morning's shootaround."
,"Seth Curry (shoulder) questionable Wednesday: The minor shoulder issue forced Curry to the sidelines on Monday night, which allowed Yogi Ferrell to return to the starting five and J.J. Barea was able to flirt with 30 minutes off the bench. It'll be more of the same if Curry is again out tonight, with both Barea and Ferrell qualifying as potential DFS targets. Stay tuned."
,"David Nwaba scores eight points: He finished 4-of-5 from the field and it's clear that the Lakers want to take a long look at him -- Nick Young is completely out of the rotation. Nwaba is looking at a short-term boost in minutes with Brandon Ingram (knee) on the shelf and coach Luke Walton said he's been 'spectacular,' but he's only worth keeping an eye on in deeper leagues for now."
,"Jordan Clarkson scores 22 points: He was playing with a bruised fifth metacarpal, but it didn't seem to bother him as he finished with four rebounds, three assists and two triples in 39 minutes. 'Hes been one of our more consistent players and we have a lot more and higher expectations of the player hes going to become,' coach Luke Walton said of Clarkson earlier this week. Nick Young isn't even in the rotation anymore, so Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell are both poised to finish the season strong."
,"D'Angelo Russell scores 28 w/ nine assists: He was well on pace for a triple-double, but the Lakers had a meltdown in the fourth quarter when they were outscored 37-13. Regardless, Russell shot 10-of-21 from the field and hit all four of his free throws, drawing the praise of head coach Luke Walton after the game -- Walton said he looked 'brilliant' and praised him for his aggressiveness, passing and how he pushed the pace. Russell's value is locked and loaded the rest of the way, assuming Walton doesn't bench him again."
,"Ian Mahinmi (hip) returns to action: He finished 3-of-4 from the field with five rebounds and two steals, and while he showed no signs of being limited, his workload will be low while Marcin Gortat is healthy. Leave Mahinmi on the wire."
,"Bojan Bogdanovic (back) returns to action: Maybe the Wizards were taking it easy on him, as he only played 16 minutes with one rebound, one assist and one steal. It also doesn't help that Kelly Oubre is playing much better these days. He did score 17 points in his previous game before missing Saturday's contest vs. Cleveland, but standard-league owners should probably look elsewhere for consistent production."
,"John Wall scores 34 w/ 14 assists in win: Trailing by 13 points entering the fourth, the Wizards outscored the Lakers 37-13 in the final quarter. Wall finished 14-of-25 from the field and 5-of-5 from the line with three rebounds, four steals and one triple in 37 minutes, improving the Wizards to 30-12 since the new year. The Wizards play three more times this week against the Clippers on Wednesday, the Jazz on Friday and the Warriors on Sunday."
,"Will Barton scores 13 points in loss: He shot 6-of-14 from the field and only played 20 minutes, so his value has fallen off a cliff since Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari returned to the lineup. Barton's owners outside of deeper leagues can move on since the Nuggets only play two more times this week."
,"Nikola Jokic flirts with a triple-double: The Nuggets didn't get the win and Jokic was outplayed by former teammate Jusuf Nurkic, but the good news for his fantasy owners is he should be locked in the rest of the way as the Nuggets try to steal the No. 8 seed back from Portland. The Nuggets have the best offensive rating in the NBA since Jokic moved back into the starting lineup on Dec. 15, so the future is bright for Denver regardless of where they finish the year."
,"Mason Plumlee goes scoreless in 16 minutes: Jusuf Nurkic (33 points, 16 rebounds) believes in revenge games, but Plumlee apparently doesn't. He missed all four of his shots from the field with two rebounds, three assists and one block, and he also had a couple of key turnovers during Portland's run to end the third quarter. The Nuggets are healthy and playing more small-ball, so Plumlee isn't worth owning in standard leagues."
,"Jameer Nelson scores 23 points in loss to POR: He logged 34 minutes and shot an impressive 8-of-11 from the field with four assists, three rebounds and four triples. The Nuggets trail the No. 8 seed (Portland) by a single game with eight games remaining on the schedule, so there's no reason to think that coach Michael Malone will reduce Nelson's workload in favor of Jamal Murray or Emmanuel Mudiay while the Nuggets are in the mix for a playoff spot. Denver only plays two more times this week, so Nelson might be on a lot of benches in weekly formats."
,"Al-Farouq Aminu scores 15 off the bench: Aminu's minutes are trending down with Noah Vonleh playing well, but he got a small bump with Moe Harkless in foul trouble tonight. He was only averaging 8.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, 0.7 blocks, 0.9 steals and 1.0 3-pointers in March prior to tonight, and keep in mind that the Blazers only have two more games this week. He's more of a streaming option in deeper leagues."
,"C.J. McCollum drops 39 points on 15-of-24 FGs: Portland has now won a season-high tying four straight games and improved to 12-3 in March which ties them with San Antonio for the league's best record in that span. As for McCollum, this was the second- highest scoring game of his career and he finished four points shy of his career-high (43). He hit all six of his free throws with five rebounds, three assists, one steal and three triples in 40 minutes, and with the Blazers holding a 1.0 game advantage over Denver for the No. 8 seed, McCollum should be an elite option the rest of the way."
,"Goran Dragic leads Heat with 28 points: There was once a time when everyone was worried about him being traded, but those days are long gone. Now he's simply the Heat's most reliable player as they fight for their playoff lives."
,"James Johnson scores 16 in win over Pistons: He's quietly been playing very well again, scoring in double figures in 10 straight games and averaging 16 points, 4.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.2 steals, 1.8 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers on 42 percent shooting over his last five. And tonight's game was his first without a block and a steal in his last five games, as well. The fact the Heat are fighting for their playoff lives also works in his favor, so just keep rolling him out there."
,"Josh Richardson struggles, still produces: We're done making excuses for Richardson, but it was nice to see him come through with a decent line on a poor shooting night. However, he hit just 3-of-10 shots on Sunday, making him 6-of-21 over his last two games. The minutes are there and the time is right for Richardson to finally have one of those epic fantasy lines. Maybe it will happen against the struggling Knicks on Wednesday night."
,"Nurk Alert: Jusuf Nurkic scores 33 vs. Denver: He wanted this win in the worst way and his teammates swarmed him after his career night with the Blazer crowd chanting his name like a scene in Gladiator. He ripped down 16 rebounds with two assists and three blocks in 33 minutes, giving his team a 1.0 game lead over the Nuggets for the No. 8 seed in the West. He's been phenomenal since his move to Portland and he will likely be on a lot of championship rosters in fantasy leagues."
,"Rodney McGruder plays well in big win: He's played pretty well in two of his last three games, but he's not a stat stuffer and is just as likely to cool off over the next few games as he is get hot. He belongs on waivers in most formats."
,"Hassan Whiteside hits game-winner over DET: It wasn't his best game, by far, but he came through in the clutch, keeping the Heat one game in front of the Bulls for the final playoff spot in the East. And because of that, you can expect the Heat regulars to keep playing heavy minutes until further notice."
,"Tobias Harris plays well off Pistons bench: Stan Van Gundy tried to mix things up by benching Harris and starting Jon Leuer in the midst of a four-game losing streak, but that number is now up to five straight losses. Leuer was awful tonight and Harris has played well whether starting or coming off the bench."
,"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope bounces back: KCP had been mired in a slump, scoring a grand total of 25 points over his last three games while connecting on just 7-of-27 shots over that stretch. Maybe tonight signals an end to the funk and we'll find out when the Pistons play the lowly Nets on Thursday."
,"Tyler Ulis double-doubles in loss: This was his fourth double-double of the season and they have all come in March. He only shot 6-of-16 from the field and his field goal percentage has been an issue, as he was hitting just 40.0 percent in his previous 14 games. Still, it's hard to complain about a player you picked up off the wire who's averaging 11.6 points, 7.5 assists and 1.4 steals this month."
,"Ish Smith cooking for Pistons right now: He's played very well in two straight games and with talk of Jackson being shut down for good this season, Smith is as must-own as they come in all formats right now."
,"Alan Williams gets into foul trouble: Williams and Marquese Chriss combined for 10 fouls in 34 minutes. He's no stranger to foul trouble, as he has picked up at least four fouls in 11 out of 15 games in March. That limits his upside and he's not a great free throw shooter by any means, but he's still worth owning for his points, rebounds and blocks -- he was averaging 11.9 points, 10.5 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in his previous 14 games this month."
,"Jon Leuer fizzles in surprise start: Harris came off the bench for 19 points, six boards, two steals and four 3-pointers, even though Stan Van Gundy said previously that Harris would start the rest of the way. Either way, Leuer has been pretty bad whether starting or coming off the bench lately, and belongs on waiver wires."
,"Marquese Chriss gets into foul trouble: When you average 5.6 fouls per 36 minutes, you're going to be prone to duds like these. The rookie also shot just 2-of-11 from the field, but he will have three more chances to redeem himself this week and has been solid for the most part since the All-Star break. Stick with him."
,"Andre Iguodala plays well in win over HOU: The Warriors plan on giving us an update on Kevin Durant on Wednesday, but we'll be shocked if he's due back any time soon. In the meantime, Iguodala has been a nice plug-and-play option for fantasy owners fighting for a championship."
,"Derrick Jones Jr. scores 13 points in loss: He finished 6-of-11 from the field and hit the first 3-pointer of his NBA career, adding three rebounds and one steal. Jones Jr. is a ton of fun to watch for his high-flying dunks and sound defense, but he's a long ways away from helping most fantasy owners -- he averaged 4.0 points and 4.6 rebounds in five previous starts this season."
,"Steph Curry drops 32-10-7 on Harden, Rockets: James Harden's line was a triple-double, but the Warriors got the win. And while Curry's production was a bone of contention for his owners this season, he might be ready to finish in a flurry. If you're still in the playoffs, he might be ready to carry your team to a championship. And coach Steve Kerr said after the game he plans on playing all his guys on Wednesday at San Antonio."
,"Klay Thompson scores 25 in Warriors win: Klay had an eight-point dud on Friday, but has been out of this world otherwise. And the best news is that the Warriors plan on playing everyone on Wednesday against the Spurs. 'Guys are good to go, the schedule has been fine and we'll go in there and see what we can do,' said coach Steve Kerr."
,"T.J. Warren scores 24 points w/ monster line: Devin Booker (ankle, rest) sat this one out, so Warren was the clear focal point of the offense. He finished 11-of-20 from the field and 2-of-2 from the line, and the fact that he logged 40 minutes suggests that the foot contusion that held him out of a pair of games last week is behind him. Warren should be owned in all leagues and his owners can deploy him three more times this week."
,"Ronnie Price (left leg contusion) returns: He has very little fantasy value and is basically in there to give Tyler Ulis an occasional breather. Leave Price  on the wire."
,"Leandro Barbosa (hamstring) doesn't play: The Suns are tanking and don't even bother to update their injury reports anymore. They will be cautious with the veteran and he can be left on the waiver wire in all standard leagues."
,"Draymond Green says left ankle is OK: Dray had 19 points, nine rebounds, four assists, three steals and a 3-pointer on Tuesday and hit 9-of-15 shots in 33 minutes for one of his better games in recent memory. The Warriors will play again on Wednesday night against the Spurs, and coach Steve Kerr said after the game he has no plans to rest anyone, adding 'guys are good to go.' Green should still be considered a game-time decision until we get final word on whether he'll play or not, but for now, it sounds like he's a lot closer to probable than doubtful."
,"Ersan Ilyasova double-doubles in win: This was his first double-double as a member of the Hawks. He finished 6-of-15 from the field and 4-of-6 from the line with one assist, one steal and two triples in 33 minutes, and he's worth deploying in standard leagues with Paul Millsap (knee) out at least two more games. Hopefully he will go on a run now that he snapped his streak of three straight games with single-digit points."
,"Lou Williams hot again, scores 17 in loss: Sweet Lou had 31 points on 11-of-15 shooting with seven triples on Sunday and while he wasn't nearly as good tonight, he still came through with some points. Eric Gordon is cold and Ryan Anderson is injured, so Williams is once again a fantasy factor until further notice."
,"Nene scores six points in 18 minutes: Nene played tonight and is expected to play again on Thursday at Portland, but will then be rested on Friday at Golden State. Not that his absence will have any fantasy impacts, other than making Clint Capela look even better in that one."
,"Dennis Schroder scores 27 points: The 27 FGAs is a career-high, but it's not a surprise with Thabo Sefolosha (groin), Paul Millsap (knee) and Kent Bazemore (knee) all on the shelf tonight. Schroder added nine assists, six rebounds, one steal and two triples, and he's rolling with averages of 23.4 points, 7.2 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 0.8 blocks, 0.8 steals and 2.0 triples over his last five games. This has been his best stretch of the season and he couldn't have timed it better for his fantasy owners."
,"James Harden triple-doubles, hurts wrist: He hit just 5-of-20 shots and 1-of-9 3-pointers, but was a perfect 13-of-13 from the line. As for his left wrist injury, coach Mike D'Antoni said it was bothering Harden during the game and that it might be something to 'look at.' It was also wrapped in ice after the game, ironically, on the same day Harden's comments about guys not resting so as not to let their teammates down emerged. If Harden sits, it's going to be because he's hurt, but he hasn't missed a game this season and we doubt he's about to start now. Especially with the fact he's embattled in one of the best MVP races we've ever seen with Russell Westbrook. The Rockets visit Portland on Thursday, so owners will want to watch for news about Harden's status for that one."
,"Tim Hardaway Jr. held to two points: He couldn't take advantage of this dream matchup, adding three rebounds, three assists and one turnover in 32 minutes. His owners should give him a chance to redeem himself on Wednesday vs. the 76ers, especially since he has averages of 19.4 points, 2.9 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.2 steals and 2.3 triples in his previous 14 games this month. Just keep in mind that his minutes could take a slight hit with Kent Bazemore (knee) returning on Wednesday."
,"Kent Bazemore (knee) will play Wednesday: He has missed five games in a row, so he might be limited upon his return. Bazemore has been a headache to own in fantasy this season, so he's just a low-end pickup with averages of 11.0 points, 3.1 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.2 triples on 40.7 percent shooting. His return could send Tim Hardaway Jr. to the bench."
,"Trevor Ariza hot, swipes six steals: Ariza had 24 points, three steals and six 3-pointers in his previous game and is averaging 14.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.8 steals and 2.5 3-pointers over his last four games. If he was dumped in your league, it's time to grab him."
,"Taurean Prince scores 15 points w/ two blocks: He finished 5-of-10 from the field and 4-of-5 from the line. Coach Mike Budenholzer said before the game that Prince 'is really coming in the right direction' and added that he was 'great' in his previous start -- he went off for 17 points, six boards, one assist, three steals, one block and two triples in 38 minutes vs. the Nets on Monday. Thabo Sefolosha (groin) isn't expected to return on Wednesday vs. the 76ers, so Prince is  worth a long look if you need some money stats (steals, blocks and triples)."
,"Kris Dunn plays 26 minutes off Wolves bench: Shabazz Muhammad played just nine minutes and Omri Casspi got just 11, while Dunn has played at least 24 minutes in each of his last four games. He's averaging 12.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 1.7 blocks over his last three, and it's time to pick him up if you have a need in a guard slot. He also became just the fourth Wolves rookie to record three steals and three blocks in a game, joining Kevin Garnett, Christian Laettner and Donyell Marshall."
,"Jeremy Lin shoots 4-of-14 in loss: At least he's healthy. Lin logged 30 minutes and salvaged his line with seven assists, six rebounds and four steals, but he missed all four of his 3-point attempts and finished 3-of-4 from the line. Lin could be shut down at any time with just eight games remaining, so get into the habit of checking the injury report prior to every game."
,"Ricky Rubio posts big double-double with FTs: He also hit the game-winning free throws late, which should give him a boost of confidence as well. Rubio was struggling pretty badly earlier in the season, but has turned it around to become a force down the stretch. If you bought low or held onto him through the dark period, it's paying off right now. He's averaging 15 points, 10.0 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.0 3-pointers on 39 percent shooting over his last five games, but also hasn't missed a free throw in his last eight games (38-of-38)."
,"Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scores 11 points: That's quite a line from RHJ and he's shown flashes of his upside all season, but the consistency hasn't been there and his minutes are still hovering around the low 20s. He shot just 5-of-15 from the field and 1-of-2 from the line, but he could get a nice bump if the Nets shut some veterans down in the last couple weeks. For now, RHJ will continue to be a nice source of rebounds, steals and blocks."
,"Karl-Anthony Towns scores 37 in tough win: Towns scored just 16 points in his previous game, but is still averaging 27.2 points, 10.2 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and 1.6 3-pointers over his last five games. The only remaining question is just how high will he go in next year's drafts? The answer is, pretty dang high."
,"Gorgui Dieng scores 19 in Wolves win: This was one of Dieng's better lines of the season and he's scored in double figures in three straight games. His minutes are up and he's shooting it well right now, so if he was dropped in your league, he's certainly worth a look if you have a hole at power forward. Over his last three games, Dieng is averaging 15.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 2.3 blocks while playing 39 minutes per game."
,"Brook Lopez scores 26 points in loss: The 76ers had no answer for him as both Richaun Holmes and Shawn Long got into some foul trouble. Lopez added nine rebounds, six assists, two blocks and three triples in 31 minutes, and his owners are fortunate that there hasn't been any mention of a possible shut-down. Keep rolling him out there."
,"Monta Ellis scores 19 in start for Pacers: He's played very well in three straight games and might be the starting shooting guard going forward. He's scored in double digits in three straight games, averaging 15.3 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.3 3-pointers over his last three games. He's hit 19-of-31 shots over that stretch, good for 61 percent, and might be worth picking up if you are looking for a shooting guard right now. He displaced C.J. Miles in the starting unit two games ago and while the Pacers lost tonight, the move could stick."
,"T.J. McConnell hands out 10 assists: This was his 14th career game with 10+ assists. Sergio Rodriguez (left hamstring strain) will miss at least a week of action, so McConnell's minutes are all but locked into the 30s. He won't carry your fantasy team, but should be a nice source of assists and steals the rest of the way."
,"Jeff Teague drops 20 & 10 in loss to MIN: Teague didn't hit a 3-pointer or block a shot, but no one is going to complain about this line. The Pacers are in a playoff dogfight right now and Teague is averaging 20.6 points, 6.8 assists and 2.2 3-pointers on 53 percent shooting over his last five games. He's going to play every night and should be started with confidence the rest of the way."
,"Timothe Luwawu scores 17 points w/ four treys: TLC got a nice bump because Gerald Henderson (hip) didn't play tonight, but he's expected back on Wednesday vs. the Hawks. The rookie finished 5-of-12 from the field and hoisted up 10 3-point attempts, adding nine rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. This was his first good line in over a week, so we'll need to see him do it again."
,"Paul George drops 37 points in tough loss: This was his fifth 30-point game in March and he's pretty much been killing it ever since the All-Star break. He's a no-brainer start the rest of the way and looked great against the Wolves, despite his team losing in the end."
,"Dario Saric scores 23 points on 8-of-15 FGs: This was his 14th game with 20+ points which ranks second in the NBA for rookies -- Joel 'The Process' Embiid still ranks 1st with 19 such games. Saric grabbed seven rebounds with one assist, one block and one triple, and he also had to play a bit of center tonight with the 76ers only having nine available players. The 76ers play three more times this week and Saric should eat the rest of the way."
,"Thaddeus Young plays well vs. Wolves: Young played for the Wolves for a cup of coffee in 2014, so maybe he had some revenge in mind. He's been pretty awful, scoring no more than eight points in any of his previous four games, and this was just his second double-digit scoring night over his last eight. Maybe this is a sign he's about to finally get hot, but we'll need to see it a few more times before actually getting excited."
,"Derrick Favors (knee) out Wednesday: He's out indefinitely and there's no timetable for his return. It's been a lost season for Favors and he belongs on the waiver wire in standard leagues."
,"Gordon Hayward is questionable Wednesday: This isn't really an update, but his owners can expect a real one after Wednesday's morning shootaround. If Hayward misses his second game in a row, Joe Ingles is the clear pickup in fantasy after he scored 19 points with five triples on Monday. Joe Johnson will also benefit."
,"Khris Middleton scores 14 despite illness: It was a pretty empty line for Middleton tonight, but he's been pretty awesome since returning from his torn hamstring. He fought through his stomach problem tonight and should bounce back in his next one."
,"Malcolm Brogdon gets hot for double-double: Brogdon has now scored exactly 14 points in three straight and he had 12 points in his previous game. He's averaging 12.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 3-pointers on 57 percent shooting over his last five games. He should already be owned by someone in your playoffs, but if he's still sitting out there, picking him up makes a ton of sense."
,"Tony Snell leads Bucks to win over Hornets: Snell finally put it all together tonight, but was still lacking in categories other than scoring. He's been a good source of 3-pointers and has scored in double figures in nine of his last 13 games. But unless you're simply desperate for 3-pointers, he's not someone we'd target in most instances. Prior to tonight's game, Snell was averaging just 9.7 points, 3.2 rebounds 1.0 steals and 1.9 3 points in 30 minutes a game for the Bucks in March, without a blocked shot and just 1.4 assists per game."
,"Robert Covington scores 21 w/ 13 boards: The 76ers only dressed nine players, so RoCo logged 38 minutes and posted a gem of a line with one assist, two steals, two blocks and one triple. The biggest knock on him is that he doesn't shoot it efficiently from the field, but he hit 9-of-15 shots in addition to a pair of free throws. He's been a top-12 player in standard fantasy leagues for two months and is a monster in real life too -- he's ranked inside the top five in the entire league in Defensive Real Plus-Minus."
,"Tiago Splitter makes 76ers debut: He looked absolutely exhausted, but keep in mind that he hasn't played since January of 2016. Unless the 76ers shut down Jahlil Okafor (knee), Splitter is only going to see a handful of minutes here and there. Fantasy owners should ignore him."
,"Jeremy Lamb scores 16 off Hornets bench: He helped the Hornets make this a game, but they didn't get it done in the end. Lamb hadn't scored more than four points in his previous three games and simply got hot tonight. As long as his starting teammates are healthy, he has no fantasy value."
,"Frank Kaminsky scores 20 in loss to Bucks: Cody Zeller was nearly invisible in his 29 minutes tonight and Kaminsky, along with Jeremy Lamb, helped lead the Hornets back and keep from making this one a blowout. Outside of an 0-for-9 dud last Friday, Kaminsky's been pretty good over the last few weeks."
,"Draymond Green tweaks ankle, will return: He was in the locker room for about five minutes and had a noticeable limp at first, but he had his ankle re-taped and looked much better walking back to the bench. We'll have an update after the game, but it looks like his owners dodged a bullet."
,"Cody Zeller quiet in loss to Bucks: Zeller had scored in double figures in three straight games and was putting up solid numbers over his last several, but just sort of disappeared tonight. He's shooting it lights-out right now and should bounce back in his next game, as he came in averaging 15.3 points and 8.0 rebounds on 19-of-25 shooting over his previous three games."
,"Nicolas Batum, Hornets struggle in loss: Marvin Williams hit 1-of-5 shots for six points and seven boards, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Cody Zeller also struggled in the loss. Kemba Walker came through with a nice game, but it was bench players Frank Kaminsky and Jeremy Lamb that brought the Hornets back to at least make it a game. Batum spent a lot of time matched up against defensive-wiz Giannis Antetokounmpo, and it showed in his stat line tonight."
,"DeMarcus Cousins is questionable Wednesday: The big man has missed two games in a row and the Pelicans haven't said much about the injury. The Pelicans will hold a shootaround Wednesday morning, so that's when his owners will have a better idea of his status. If he's out, Dante Cunningham will likely start, but you would have to be very desperate to look his way. Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis will have higher ceilings if Boogie sits."
,"James Michael McAdoo won't return: He received seven stitches above his left eyebrow, but the good news is that he doesn't have a concussion. He shouldn't miss additional time, but there are no fantasy implications here."
,"Ian Mahinmi and Bogdanovic will play Tuesday: Mahinmi went through a full practice on Monday and should be ready for his normal workload off the bench. However, fantasy owners can continue to ignore him while Marcin Gortat is healthy."
,"Jordan Clarkson (hand) will play Tuesday: He was diagnosed with a bruised fifth metacarpal on Sunday, but he was able to play through the injury. We'll let you know how he fares tonight, but his fantasy owners can go ahead and deploy him in lineups."
,"McAdoo being evaluated for a concussion: He had a nasty gash on his head and will need stitches. McAdoo is also being evaluated for a concussion, so his night could be over. He's averaging 8.7 minutes per game on the season, so this won't impact fantasy owners."
,"Reggie Bullock (foot) ruled out Tuesday: Only limited fantasy impact here, as Bullock has been on the fringes of the Detroit rotation for most of the season. Stanley Johnson may see a few more minutes off the bench."
,"Tobias Harris back to the bench on Tuesday: This won't have much impact on Harris' fantasy value. In fact, Tobias is posting better numbers off the bench. In 47 games as a starter this season, he is averaging 15.9 points and 4.9 rebounds in 33.1 minutes. In 27 games as a reserve, Harris is averaging 16.6 points and 5.4 boards in 28.9 minutes."
,"Jon Leuer starting, Tobias Harris to bench: Interesting. Coach Stan Van Gundy previously said that Harris would start for the rest of the season, but the Pistons have lost four straight games and SVG is going to shake things up. Leuer's numbers only get a modest bump in the first unit, so he's just a low-end pickup. The big man is averaging 10.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 0.4 triples in March."
,"Taurean Prince starting again on Tuesday: Thabo Sefolosha (groin), Paul Millsap (knee) and Kent Bazemore (knee) are all out, and Bazemore is the only player expected back on Wednesday. That means Prince is looking at a significant workload tonight and could have some nice short-term value this whole week. In his previous start, Prince went off for 17 points, six boards, one assist, three steals, one block and two triples in 38 minutes."
,"Derrick Jones Jr. starting for Devin Booker: Booker has an 'ankle' injury, but there have been some reports that the tanking Suns are just resting him. Jones is more of a defender who rarely scores outside of the paint, so there's not much fantasy upside here. In five starts this season, Jones has averaged 4.0 points and 4.6 rebounds."
,"Andrew Nicholson inactive on Tuesday: Very little fantasy impact here, as Nicholson had only been seeing sporadic minutes and was a DNP-CD in Brooklyn's previous game.
"
,"Fred VanVleet recalled from the D-League: He'll help backup Cory Joseph at the point guard spot on Wednesday, but he won't be earning enough minutes to matter in most leagues."
,"Nene (rest) will pay Tuesday, but not Friday: Montrezl Harrell (personal) will be away from the team for the next two games, but will be back by Friday. With Nene resting that night, he'll serve as Clint Capela's backup."
,"Dubs will provide update on Durant Wednesday: Durant has looked great while going through his pregame routines as of late, and he'll be re-evaluated on Wednesday, after which, the Warriors will offer an update. Durant was initially targeting a mid-April return, but we'll have to wait for tomorrow's update to see if anything has changed on that speculative timetable. He might be worth a speculative add in deep leagues with things trending in a positive direction, but know that he'll be on a strict minutes limit upon his return."
,"Montrezl Harrell (baby) out for next 2 games: His girlfriend is having a baby, so Harrell will be unavailable for the next two. He's been out of the rotation over the past four, though, so his absence won't have any consequence in fantasy hoops."
,"Sergio Rodriguez (hamstring) out a week: Rodriguez will be re-evaluated next week, so there is no guarantee he will be able to return at that point. He belongs on waivers in all leagues. Starter T.J. McConnell will see extended minutes with Rodriguez on the shelf. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Nik Stauskas are also candidates to see more minutes."
,"Tiago Splitter (calf) available to play Tues: Splitter hasn't taken the court since January of 2016, so if he is able to get out there tonight, it will likely be in an extremely limited capacity. Leave him on the wire."
,"Devin Booker (ankle) out Tuesday vs. Atlanta: Booker has been dealing with this ankle issue since March 19, and apparently aggravated it during his 70-point explosion against the Celtics, so for now, we'll be considering him questionable for Thursday's game against the Clippers. Derrick Jones Jr. will likely slide into the starting five tonight sans Booker, while T.J. Warren will be tasked with the heavy lifting on offense. Jones Jr. isn't a great target in most settings, but Warren makes sense in DFS, as he'll easily be Phoenix's go-to guy on offense tonight."
,"Sean Kilpatrick (hamstring) will play Tuesday: Kilpatrick had missed seven straight games. Coach Kenny Atkinson said that Kilpatrick will get some minutes 'here and there,' so we can expect him to see limited playing time on Tuesday. Kilpatrick will eat into the minutes of K.J. McDaniels and Randy Foye."
,"Reggie Jackson (knee) out Tuesday vs. Miami: There have been recent reports speculating that the Pistons may eventually elect to shut down Jackson, but Stan Van Gundy stated during his pre-game interview that Jackson is simply day-to-day and stressed that he really wants to play. That being said, Jackson has been playing terribly for the past month, so there's little incentive to hang onto him in most leagues. Ish Smith will earn another start tonight, and he's worth a look if you need some dimes and steals."
,"Khris Middleton (illness) will play Tuesday: Middleton missed shootaround this morning, but fortunately is feeling better. Fantasy owners can breathe a sign of relief and feel comfortable inserting him into their starting lineup. Middleton is averaging 16.9 points, 4.0 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.8 treys over the Bucks last 15 games."
