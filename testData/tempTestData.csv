,"Cory Joseph plays 26 minutes off bench Wed: CoJo exploded as a starter on Tuesday with 33 points, four boards and four assists, but that was the result of a perfect storm -- Kyle Lowry was resting and he was up against the Nets' terrible defense. He's barely inside the top-200 for season-long value."
,"Jared Sullinger plays 14 minutes in debut: The Raptors are going to be very cautious with Sullinger, as they were with DeMarre Carroll, and he'll be subject to limited minutes and occasional DNP-CDs until further notice. He should play both PF and backup C once he's up to speed, but most owners shouldn't stash him just yet."
,"DeMar DeRozan hits 11-of-21 FGs for 25 pts: He added six assists, three boards, one steal and just two turnovers. It's all a bonus for his fantasy owners, as coach Dwane Casey hinted earlier in the day that DeRozan might rest in the second of back-to-back games. Toronto gets consecutive games again on Jan. 24-25, so owners should be on the lookout for a potential rest day next week."
,"Jonas Valanciunas grabs 16 rebounds vs. PHI: Lucas Nogueira was out tonight due to a concussion and JV had his own scare when his head hit the court in the fourth quarter. He never left the game, however, so we're leaving him off the injury report unless a pessimistic update surfaces prior to Friday's road game."
,"Kyle Lowry returns with 24/4/4, five steals: He made 5-of-13 field goals and 11-of-16 free throws in 40 minutes, but it wasn't enough to knock off the surging 76ers in Philly. Lowry passed Zach LaVine for the league lead in minutes per game tonight, at 37.3, and it's not surprising to see the Raptors find him a rest day. His owners should keep an eye out for updates with another back-to-back set looming on Jan. 24/25."
,"JaMychal Green back in the swing of things: That's two games in a row with at least 14 points after failing to hit double digits in points for his first five games of 2017. Green has seen a few slumps before, but he's still proven he should be owned in standard leagues with ninth-round value on the year."
,"Avery Bradley could miss more time: 'Maybe he came back too soon,' Stevens said. The Celtics are usually very careful with their hurt players, so it sounds like Bradley could be looking at multiple games out of the lineup due to his sore Achilles. Until he can return, we'll see more Marcus Smart in the starting lineup while Terry Rozier and Jaylen Brown should get minutes. Smart should be owned in most leagues while Rozier is worth a look in deeper leagues."
,"Chandler Parsons has another terrible game: He was just 1-of-6 from the field to drop him to just 36.7 percent from the field on the season. Parsons has been an unmitigated disaster for his fantasy owners to this point and has barely been a top-300 player per game on the season. If there is anything promising out there, it makes some sense to drop Parsons."
,"Jodie Meeks (dislocated thumb) out for game: The good news is X-rays were negative, so he didn't break anything. That said, he will need an MRI on Thursday to check for ligament damage. Meeks finished with five points, four rebounds, two steals and two turnovers in 16 minutes. Maybe, just maybe coach Frank Vogel will play Mario Hezonja, who is only worth a speculative add in very deep leagues for now. C.J. Watson should also get more minutes."
,"Ty Lawson (ankle) ruled out for Wednesday: He tried to test out his ankle, but apparently wasn't as healthy as expected. With Lawson out tonight. Garrett Temple should get some minutes as the backup point guard to go with some minutes at the two. Darren Collison is also coming off a 21-pont game and could have some success against his former team."
,"Ty Lawson expected to play on Wednesday: This is a pretty much non-update, but it may also be the last one with how the Kings report their injuries. For now, expect Lawson to play and get minutes in the low 20s."
,"Jerami Grant starting again: The Warriors attack Enes Kanter like he is four feet tall, so the Thunder will go small again with Domantas Sabonis shifting over to the five. Both Grant and Sabonis are worth using in DFS tonight while Grant is worth a look for short-term value."
,"Klay Thompson (personal) will play Wednesday: Thompson flew back from Portland and he made it to the arena with enough time to ensure that he'll be in the starting lineup. Get him into your active lineups."
,"DeMarre Carroll (sore neck) will not return: Carroll took a knee to the head while falling and the good news is that there's no mention of a concussion -- tests came back negative and it's being described as something similar to whiplash. Terrence Ross should gain the most if Carroll is forced to miss any games, with Norman Powell also stepping into a bigger role. The Raptors next game is Friday in Charlotte."
,"Klay Thompson (personal) is a game-time call: His plane landed at 5:40 local time, so he has almost two hours to get to the arena and play. Thompson will get some shots up before the game and see how he feels after that. For now, we are considering him as closer to probable."
,"Anthony Davis returns to action vs. Magic: X-rays were negative on his left hand and he should be OK. Hopefully, he can stay healthy for the rest of the game tonight."
,"DeMarre Carroll goes to the locker room: He was falling to the ground and Pascal Siakam's knee caught him as he was falling. Carroll was down for about two minutes and he needed some help off the court, so he may be dealing with a concussion. If he's out, Terrence Ross and Norman Powell would benefit. Ross is the better speculative add because he's played better late;y."
,"Anthony Davis (hand) probable to return: It looks like he'll be OK. Davis had a right thumb injury before today, but he now has a new splint on his ring and pinkie fingers. Davis had a trainer go to the locker room walk back there with him, so maybe he's getting an X-ray. It sounds like he's OK."
,"Tim Hardaway Jr. will come off the bench Weds: The Hawks will roll out a starting five featuring Dennis Schroder, Thabo Sefolosha, Kent Bazemore, Paul Millsap and Dwight Howard (rest), but Hardaway should still be able to flirt with minutes in the 30s regardless of how he enters the game. He's been averaging 16.9 points and 2.9 triples per contest through the month of January, so he's worth owning while he's this hot."
,"Dwight Howard back, Hardaway Jr. to bench: He should see his normal playing time, assuming he can avoid foul trouble against Andre Drummond. Even though Hardaway Jr. is coming off the bench, he's still a hold."
,"ESPN: Ben Simmons could debut after AS break: The report adds the No. 1 pick has a chance to make his NBA debut 'near March,' assuming he doesn't have a setback. He went through 5-on-5 for the first time last week and continues to do some work pre-game, including on the road. He'll likely have a minutes limit upon his return, so it may be a while before he's contributing reliable production. Simmons is a questionable stash in standard leagues, especially if you need to make up ground in the standings."
,"Marcus Smart starting w/ Avery Bradley out: Bradley can't shake the injury and his absence opens things up for Smart, who is a nice plug-and-play option until the Celtics' backcourt is at full strength."
,"Avery Bradley (Achilles) will not play vs. NY: He returned to action on Monday, but the Celtics will hold him out. Presumably, this is more of a precaution than anything with the Celtics not on a back-to-back set. With him out, Marcus Smart figures to get the start while Terry Rozier, Gerald Green and Jaylen Brown could play more. Bradley was off to a fantastic start this season, but it may take him some time to get right with this nagging injury."
,"Kristaps Porzingis set to undergo an MRI: 'Hes fine if hes shooting a jump shot or something, but when he really pushes off hard to drive the ball hes feeling a little pinch in the heel,' said head coach Jeff Hornacek. 'Theyre giving him treatment and trying to get rid of that but I think thats the last step and then he can play.' Porzingis will miss his fourth consecutive game on Wednesday, but we should get a better idea on his potential return date once the MRI results are released. Stay tuned."
,"Kyle Lowry will start vs. 76ers: He should be busy in a hometown game. Lowry is also somewhat fresh after getting Tuesday off."
,"Confirmed: DeMar DeRozan will start vs. 76ers: The Raptors may want to get a win against their divisional foes. DeRozan gets a good matchup tonight, so keep him rolling in your season-long leagues."
,"Kyle O'Quinn will start Wednesday vs. Boston: O'Quinn is about as hit-or-miss as they come, but with Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles), Lance Thomas (orbital fracture) and Noah all on the sidelines Wednesday night, he's sure looking at a good amount of opportunity. He's someone to consider throwing out there as a streamer or DFS punt play."
,"Pascal Siakam will start Wednesday vs. 76ers: Through 34 starts this season, Siakam owns meager averages of 4.9 points, 3.7 boards and not much else in 18.5 minutes per game, so the rookie entering the starting five really doesn't mean all that much in fantasy hoops. Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, DeMarre Carroll and Jonas Valanciunas will join Siakam in the starting five."
,"DeMar DeRozan listed as starter vs. 76ers: The Raptors usually tweet out lineup changes on their officially Twitter account, but this isn't the source here. For now, DeRozan has a good chance to play on the second half of a back-to-back set. We'll see if there is another update on DeMar from the team before tip."
,"Confirmed: Anthony Davis will play Wednesday: Davis looked fine while going through his pregame routine, and there's been no discussion of a minutes restriction, so his owners can feel free to fire him up. Alvin Gentry may have had the quote of the year during his pregame interview, stating, 'AD will play hurt. He's played hurt since the day he got here.' Yup."
,"Evan Fournier (heel, foot) out for Wednesday: He tried to return from a heel injury last week and apparently it's caused additional problems to his foot due to compensation. Fournier's owners obviously have to stash him. Jodie Meeks should play minutes around 30 while Elfrid Payton has also been terrific without Fournier lately. Meeks is worth a look in standard leagues."
,"Clint Capela will come off the bench vs. MIL: Capela started in his return from a 15-game absence on Tuesday, but only lasted nine minutes, so it doesn't make much sense to start him while he's dealing with a minutes limit. Capela does have some nice upside, but it'll probably take him at least a week before he's really up to speed."
,"Woj: Klay Thompson intends to play vs. OKC: Thompson has told general manager Bob Myers he could fly back in time for the game tonight, so Thompson looks like he's closer to probable for this game. If he isn't back in time, we'll see more Pat McCaw Ian Clark and Andre Iguodala could play more."
,"Eric Gordon will play on Wednesday night: He should be ready to roll after a tweak of his ankle. Gordon continues to make his money when he's not on the court next to James Harden, posting a 33.2 usage rate without The Beard and only a 19.0 with him. He's worth using in standard leagues tonight."
,"Ryan Anderson (illness) out Wednesday vs. MIL: Corey Brewer got the start on Tuesday with Anderson on the sidelines, and Sam Dekker saw some increased playing time with the second unit, but neither guy did that much. Instead, James Harden took on most of the offensive burden and popped off for a 40-point triple-double, and it'll likely be more of the same this evening."
,"Jon Leuer will not play on Wednesday night: The Pistons will hold him out for his fifth game. With Leuer and Kentavious-Caldwell Pope (shoulder) out, the Pistons will have to play Reggie Bullock, Stanley Johnson and Aron Baynes more than usual. Tobias Harris and Marcus Morris also slightly benefit."
,"Harrell starting, Clint Capela to the bench: Capela is being eased back into things after a lengthy layoff, so it doesn't make sense to have him start if he's only going to play around 10 minutes or so. Harrell will likely split minutes at the five-spot with Capela and Nene, so he's not a very attractive option in most formats despite the starter tag."
,"Patrick Patterson (knee) will not play at PHI: His knee injury has kept him to just two games in 2017. Luckily for the Raptors, they have Jared Sullinger (foot) back for limited minutes -- he's likely only going to play 10-15 minutes tonight. The Raptors will also likely go smaller tonight while Pascal Siakam could play 20 minutes. None of these guys mentioned are worth using in standard leagues."
,"Jared Sullinger will make season debut in PHI: Wow. This comes as a surprise after Sullinger was cleared for practice on Jan. 13. He's coming off a foot surgery and chances are his conditioning isn't 100 percent yet. Sullinger will likely have a minutes limit for the foreseeable future, so he's only worth a pickup in deeper leagues right now. His upside isn't the greatest."
,"Lance Thomas (face) out Wednesday vs. BOS: Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) and Joakim Noah (ankle) will also be on the sidelines Wednesday night, so Mindaugas Kuzminskas will be looking at another start, with Kyle O'Quinn and Willy Hernangomez splitting minutes at the five. Kuzminskas put up 14 points, five boards, one trey, two dimes and two steals his last time out, so he's someone to consider throwing out there as a low-budget DFS target. Thomas isn't worth owning anywhere."
,"Joakim Noah (ankle) will not play Wednesday: The 31-year-old center also needs an MRI. He has a sore left ankle and didn't go through shootaround. Noah has been surprisingly healthy lately, but he could miss additional time going forward given his track record. With him out, Kyle O'Quinn should get a bump in minutes and the same goes for Willy Hernangomez. If you need a big man, KOQ is worth a pickup."
,"Roy Hibbert likely back in rotation?: Coach Steve Clifford said it had to do with the Celtics bigs taking jumpers. For now, it looks like he'll be playing on Wednesday against the Blazers, but obviously has very little fantasy value."
,"No chance Simmons plays on Jan. 27: That game was switched to national TV, which has caused some speculation about Simmons making his debut. He is doing some on-court work and the 76ers actually in the mix to make the postseason has given the team a reason to play him. Perhaps he can make his debut next month, but he's still only a questionable stash without a target date."
,"Sergio Rodriguez will come off the bench Weds: T.J. McConnell (wrist) is back in action tonight, and he'll immediately be re-inserted into the starting five, which could result in Rodriguez' minutes plunging to the teens, rendering him a non-option in most formats. Nik Stauskas, Robert Covington, Ersan Ilyasova and Joel Embiid will join McConnell in the starting five for tonight's game. <br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> With McConnell back in action, Rodriguez isn't a DFS option, but the two should continue to cut into each other's production to an extent. McConnell is a good bet for 30-32 minutes of run, but with almost the entire roster active, Joel Embiid looks like the only strong DFS target on a nine-game slate. Embiid is 4th in the NBA in usage rate and faces a Toronto defense that ranks 18th in rebounding rate and sits about league average in defensive efficiency."
,"Gary Harris will not play on Thursday: This will be his second game out of the lineup. Harris is having a tough go this year, suffering injuries to his groin, foot and now this ankle sprain. With him out, Will Barton is a must-start player in season long and is probably worth using in DFS. Jamal Murray also benefits. Harris should still probably remain owned in standard leagues despite all these injuries."
,"Joel Embiid (illness) will start on Wednesday: Embiid could be limited tonight due to the illness, but he remains a must-start guy any time he takes the court. With him active, Nerlens Noel (ankle) and Jahlil Okafor (ankle) will split the reserve minutes, with Noel offering a bit more appeal due to his defensive upside."
,"Noel will play; Embiid still questionable: Joel Embiid (illness) is still questionable to play. Noel should be looking at minutes in the low 20s regardless of Embiid's status. Jahlil Okafor could be getting minutes in the upper 20s or he could be a DNP-CD. Noel is worth owning in standard leagues right now."
,"T.J. McConnell will play against the Raptors: He went through shootaround this morning and wasn't wearing a wrist splint. McConnell went through his pre-game routine and apparently didn't have a setback. He did play through his wrist injury when he suffered it on Saturday, but he was held out on Monday. He should play close to 30 minutes while Sergio Rodriguez backs him up."
,"Danilo Gallinari probable to play on Thursday: This is fairly routine for the Nuggets with Gallo also on the injury report on Tuesday. He played 39 minutes and scored 14 points, so he's fairly close to healthy."
,"Jokic, Gallinari probable Thursday vs. SA: When they're listed as probable in Denver, that means that they'll get out there, so owners can feel confident plugging these guys in their lineups on Thursday. Jokic has been putting up top-3 numbers in 9-cat leagues over the past two weeks, so he's obviously a must-start guy every time he's active."
,"Lucas Nogueira will not play on Wednesday: He had some blurred vision on Tuesday and is still in the concussion protocol. Nogueira's fantasy owners should probably just sit tight and hope he can return this weekend. With him out, Paskal Siakam is likely to start, but fantasy owners should steer clear. The Raptors could also go small to give more run to Norman Powell and Terrence Ross."
,"Wilson Chandler (personal) is listed as out: Being listed as out isn't the same thing as being out, so hopefully we get another update on Thursday before the road game. Kenneth Faried has played really well in the first unit, which has cost Chandler some playing time. He's still worth owning, though. If he is indeed out, Faried, Jusuf Nurkic and Juan Hernangomez could play more."
,"Hawks sign Gary Neal on 10-day deal: It's only a 10-day deal for the former Spur, Wolf, Hornet, Wizard and Buck. The Hawks haven't really gotten much out of their rookie wings, so Neal may add some depth to add more scoring punch off the bench. Neal isn't worth owning almost anywhere yet."
,"Ryan Anderson (illness) questionable for Wed: He missed Tuesday's game against the Heat, which allowed Corey Brewer to get a start. If Anderson does miss another game, Brewer, Sam Dekker, Trevor Ariza and Pat Beverley could all see more run. Dekker could be a decent DFS punt today."
,"Eric Gordon not on the injury report: He looked to tweak his ankle on Tuesday and did have to leave the game. The Rockets didn't have a shootaround today, so we likely won't get another update on him until about 90 minutes before tip. For now, expect him to play in a high-scoring game as the Rockets look to bounce back from a loss on Tuesday."
,"Larry Nance getting close to a return: The training staff held him out of the final drill, but Nance wanted to participate in it. He's clearly getting close and his late-January target seems likely. Nance played 30.5 minutes per game in his previous two games prior to his injury on Dec. 20, and Luol Deng (wrist) is also banged up. If Nance can return before Deng, he may have some value in standard leagues."
,"Luol Deng (wrist) questionable for Friday: He also did not practice on Wednesday. Deng was called out indefinitely on Tuesday, so he's likely not going to play with a sprained shooting wrist. Even when he's back, the Lakers seem to be shifting to their younger players. If he's out, Brandon Ingram should continue to start and get heavy minutes, making him a target in standard leagues. The guards also benefit."
,"Robin Lopez working on 3-pointers?: If Brook [Lopez] can do it, I definitely can,' Lopez said. Robin has yet to make a 3-pointer in his entire NBA career with just five attempts. He's actually been very good on his shots from beyond 20 feet this season, making 55.0 percent of his 20 attempts. Lopez has only turned in 12th-round value on the season, so he's only a borderline hold."
,"Taj Gibson scheduled to play on Friday night: He did not practice on Wednesday, but the day off was planned before today. Before missing Monday, Gibson was coming in with some momentum with back-to-back 32-minute games on Saturday and Sunday, averaging 16.5 points and 12.0 boards in those games. Paul Zipser, Bobby Portis and Doug McDermott could lose some minutes."
,"Jared Dudley expected to be back: He's not in the rotation right now, so Dudley can remain on the wire just about everywhere."
,"Tyson Chandler should be ready for Thursday: He missed Monday's game against the Jazz because of a stomach bug. Chandler has been extremely busy this month, averaging 8.7 points, 15.5 boards, 0.7 blocks and 0.3 steals in 30.7 minutes per game. He's worth owning in standard leagues while Alex Len should still have value off the bench."
,"Brandon Knight (wrist) questionable Thursday: He has missed the last two games with his wrist sprain. Knight is barely in the rotation right now. If he's out, Tyler Ulis would likely see more minutes and it's worth a mention Devin Booker played 46 minutes in regulation on Monday. Knight needs a trade to save his value, so he may not be worth owning in shallower leagues."
,"DeAndre Jordan gets an excused absence: He'll be back and the Clippers will need him out there. Interestingly, Jordan doesn't really see a bump in usage rate without Chris Paul (hamstring) next to him while his efficiency is similar."
,"DeMar DeRozan possibly resting on Wednesday?: It makes sense after the Raptors rested Kyle Lowry in Brooklyn on Tuesday night. If DeRozan does sit, it'll likely be Norman Powell getting the start while Terrence Ross would also get a bump in playing time. Plus, Kyle Lowry could be taking a ton of shots in his hometown. Hopefully we get the starting lineup before the 7:00 EST start."
,"Update: Klay Thompson is questionable vs. OKC: It was just five minutes ago Klay was called out for this game, but now there is a chance he can make it back with the team in time for tonight after dealing with a family matter. He'll likely be a game-time call for the late start tonight, so DFS players likely won't know when it's time to set your lineup. If he's out, Pat McCaw, Ian Clark and Andre Iguodala would benefit."
,"Klay Thompson (personal) out vs. Thunder: The team says he is dealing with a 'family matter' and didn't provide additional details. This will be his second game out of the lineup in the last eight days with a rest day back on Jan. 10. For tonight, it'll likely be Patrick McCaw getting the start while Ian Clark also should see more minutes off the bench. In the last game without Klay, McCaw played 19 minutes, Clark played 22 and Andre Iguodala played 29 minutes."
,"Chris Paul undergoes surgery, out 6-8 weeks: This timetable puts CP3 back on the court right around the fantasy playoffs, but in the meantime it'll be Raymond Felton and Austin Rivers running the point in Los Angeles. Blake Griffin (knee) isn't expected to get back for at least another 1-2 weeks, so Jamal Crawford could be looked to more often on offense. If you're in a standard league and struggling in the standings without an IR-spot, selling CP3 for pennies or outright cutting him may be the only course of action here."
,"Blake Griffin about a week or two out: That means he'll be on the back end of his 4-6 week timeline from back on Dec. 20. Griffin is starting to do some on-court work and ran some sprints before Saturday's game. The Clippers may have a tough time winning games with Chris Paul (hamstring) also out. Raymond Felton and Austin Rivers should be carrying the offense."
,"Report: OKC turned off by Rudy Gay's agency: This is the same agency that represents Kevin Durant, and according to Sam Amick of USA Today, OKC management partly blames the Roc Nation agency for the departure of Durant. Amick speculates that a trade sending Gay to Miami in some sort of Goran Dragic package is more likely, although Pat Riley may prefer to wait for Gay to hit free agency rather than unload assets to grab him for half a season now. In terms of fantasy hoops, Miami would be a decent landing spot, but this is all speculation at the moment."
,"Bismack Biyombo (knee) will play Wednesday: Biyombo took a nasty spill during Monday's game, but he played through it, and after resting up on Tuesday he'll be good to go for tonight's game. Biyombo hasn't been very good this season, owning meager averages of 6.1 points, 7.6 boards and 1.3 blocks per contest, so while his bones may very well be infused with liquid adamantium, he's not worth owning in standard leagues."
,"Kevin Love (back) questionable for Thursday: Love didn't take any contact during Wednesday's practice, and with a matchup against the 13-28 Suns, the Cavs may want to play it safe with Love in order to have him 100 percent for Saturday's matchup with the Spurs. We should get another update following Thursday morning's shootaround, but it's looking like he'll be headed for a game-time call. If he's out, Channing Frye would likely draw the start, with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving being asked to do a bit more on offense."
,"Jon Leuer (knee) a game-time decision vs. ATL: Leuer did get in a full practice on Tuesday and participated during shootaround, and head coach Stan Van Gundy acknowledged that he could return to action tonight, so things are trending in a positive direction here. If Leuer does get back to the court, Tobias Harris will return to the bench and Stanley Johnson could lose some minutes. Check back closer to tip-off for an official update."
,"Jahlil Okafor (ankle) available to play Weds: Joel Embiid (illness) may be forced to sit this one out, which would essentially guarantee Okafor at least 20 minutes of floor time. That being said, Okafor is basically only good for points and boards, so he's not a very attractive target in most leagues."
,"DeAndre Bembry (personal) available to play: He's not typically in the rotation, so his playing status is irrelevant in fantasy hoops."
,"Reggie Bullock will start Wednesday vs. ATL: Bullock logged 29 minutes in a start on Sunday, but only managed to tally four points, one rebound, one assist and one steal. Yes, he's starting, but that doesn't make him a viable target in most settings."
,"Anthony Davis (hip, thumb) says he'll play: Davis really likes going up against the Magic, in eight career outings against Orlando he owns impressive averages of 18.8 points, 13.4 boards, 1.4 dimes, 1.4 steals and a whopping 4.1 swats per contest, so he's on the radar as a potential DFS target. Just check back for official confirmation on his status closer to tip-off."
,"Aron Baynes (knee) good to go for Wednesday: Baynes did not practice on Tuesday, but he was never expected to miss Wednesday's game. He doesn't have much value with Andre Drummond (knee) healthy, though."
,"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (shoulder) out Weds: This will be KCP's third straight game on the sidelines, and it's currently unclear exactly when he'll be able to get back to the court. Reggie Bullock started in Caldwell-Popes' place on Sunday, but Stanley Johnson produced the better stat line in 34 minutes off the bench. Jon Leuer (knee) went through shootaround and he could be back on the court tonight, and his return could cut into Johnson's minutes. For now, we'll consider Caldwell-Pope questionable for Saturday's game vs. the Wizards."
,"Drummond, Baynes will play Wednesday vs. ATL: Drummond and Baynes both sat out Tuesday's practice with some knee soreness, but neither injury was ever believed to be serious, so there's no reason to anticipate any sort of minutes restrictions tonight. Feel free to get Drummond active for tonight's battle of the bigs with Dwight Howard."
,"Nerlens Noel (ankle) probable for Wednesday: Noel got in a full practice on Tuesday and said that he was planning on suiting up for Wednesday's game, so it's looking like the ankle issue will only end up costing him one game on the sidelines. Joel Embiid (illness) could miss tonight's game, which would present both Noel and Jahlil Okafor with the opportunity for some extended minutes."
,"Joel Embiid (illness) questionable Wednesday: Embiid wasn't able to go through shootaround, so he's likely headed for a game-time call here. Nerlens Noel (ankle) is probable, so if Embiid is out, it'll be Jahlil Okafor and Noel manning the five-spot with Noel being the more attractive target. Stay tuned."
,"T.J. McConnell (wrist) questionable vs. TOR: McConnell said on Tuesday that he was going to 'try to play' today, and he was able to go through shootaround without wearing the wrist splint, so things are trending in a positive direction here. He was playing really well with the starting unit prior to going down, so it'll be interesting to see if he's imminently re-inserted back into the starting five, or if coach Brett Brown opts to bring him along more slowly off the bench. Either way, if T.J. gets back, Sergio Rodriguez's minutes will take a hit."
,"Ron Baker will start again on Wednesday: Ron 'Burgundy' Baker had a solid outing in his previous start, posting 12 points, four triples, three boards, one assist and two steals in his 22 minutes of floor time, so he's on the radar as a potential deep league streamer. Lee was a no-show in 21 minutes off the bench, scoring just seven points to go with one 3-pointer and not much else, so he's a cut candidate with the demotion to the second unit."
,"Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) out Wednesday: He's still dealing with soreness in his left Achilles, so the Knicks will continue to take an extremely cautious approach with their franchise big man. Joakim Noah (ankle) did not participate during shootaround and is looking doubtful, so we could see a lot of Kyle O'Quinn and Willy Hernangomez operating at the five-spot today, with Mindaugas Kusminskas earning another start at the four sans Porzingis."
,"Report: 76ers will target Jrue Holiday as UFA: Holiday will be an unrestricted free agent when the offseason hits, and Holiday will be one of the more attractive point guards on the market, and he also makes sense in Philly's system as he could work off the ball next to Ben Simmons. We still have a long way to go until free agency, so this is just something to file away for later."
,"Joakim Noah (ankle) questionable Wednesday: Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) is also questionable to play, and if neither guy is able to give it a go, Kyle O'Quinn and Willy Hernangomez would likely pick up most of the five-man minutes in New York. O'Quinn is about as hit-or-miss as they come, and as a starter this season he owns averages of 8.5 points, 8.8 boards and 0.8 blocks per game, so he's basically just a streamer if he gets the start. Stay tuned."
,"Porzingis, Noah questionable for Wednesday: Jeff Hornacek hinted on Tuesday that he was considering starting Porzingis at center for Wednesday's game, so it could be easier to justify making that move if Noah is forced to the sidelines today. Noah wasn't able to go through shootaround, so he seems a bit closer to doubtful, while Porzingis did participate. We likely won't get another update until Porzingis goes through his pregame routine, but if both guys are out, Kyle O'Quinn could draw the start at center."
,"Report: CLE unlikely to make any more trades: 'When the Cavs open the cabinet, they have nothing to give. I'd be stunned if they made a trade of consequence,' said Windhorst. 'The trade for [Kyle] Korver was a miracle. It almost caused a mutiny in the Hawks organization. That's it. The Cavs have made their moves.' The Cavs will be paying $54 million in luxury taxes this season, so they're pretty limited in what they can do, although the buyout market could present another opportunity to add a piece such as Andrew Bogut (hamstring)."
,"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope questionable vs. ATL: KCP wasn't able to practice on Tuesday, so he feels a lot closer to doubtful for tonight's game. Reggie Bullock got the call to enter the starting five on Sunday with Caldwell-Pope on the sidelines, but he didn't do much in 29 minutes of action, while Stanley Johnson produced a nice low-end line in 34 minutes off the bench. If KCP is out again, Johnson and Bullock will continue to split his minutes, with Johnson being the more attractive target."
,"Jon Leuer, KCP questionable for Wednesday: Leuer was able to practice on Tuesday, while KCP was not, so Leuer likely has a much better chance of returning to the court on Wednesday. If he is able to get back out there it'll be interesting to see if he's immediately re-inserted back into the starting five, or if Stan Van Gundy eases him back into things after spending four games on the sidelines. Either way, Stanley Johnson's minutes will likely take a slight hit with Leuer back in the fold. Stay tuned."
,"Atkinson says LeVert is pushing for more mins: The Nets 2016 first-round pick has seen his playing time rise to the lower-20s through the month of January, and he's responded with averages of 8.6 points, 1.9 dimes and 1.2 triples per game on 48.3 percent shooting. Atkinson wants LeVert to earn his minutes, and he's been doing just that with a +/- rating of +1.1 over the past nine games. He's a reasonable guy to stash, as he should be able to eventually usurp Joe Harris for the starting two-spot in Brooklyn."
,"Knicks recall Marshall Plumlee from D-League: This is literally the only thing we ever blurb about the third Plumlee. Move along folks, no fantasy value to be had here."
,"Russell blames himself for lack of 4Q minutes: 'Its been [crappy], its been real [crappy] I havent been bringing it,' Russell said of his play late in games. 'I applaud coach [Luke Walton] for not putting me on the floor the times that I havent [been bringing it].' In the past three games, Russell has been on the floor for a grand total of three minutes and 47 seconds during the fourth quarter, although he should eventually start seeing crunch time minutes once player development (and not winning) becomes Walton's primary focus."
,"Report: Hawks acquire rights to Cenk Akyol: Akyol was drafted in 2005 but he's yet to make his NBA debut, and at 29 years old, that probably won't ever happen."
,"Report: ATL to sign Gary Neal to 10-day deal: Neal is familiar with Mike Budenholzer, as Budenholzer was an assistant coach in San Antonio during his time there, although we're not expecting much from him in Atlanta. He'll be competing for playing time with the likes of Tim Hardaway Jr., Mike Dunleavy and Kent Bazemore, so he's not a great add in most settings."
,"Report: Atlanta trading Mo Williams to Denver: Denver will be sending the rights to Cenk Akyol (drafted in 2005 and yet to make his NBA debut) back to Atlanta in exchange for Williams, but it's unlikely Akyol will ever play a game in the NBA. The actual corresponding move here for the Hawks will be signing Gary Neal to a 10-day contract. Williams is going to be waived in Denver, and the 13-year-veteran may have already played his final NBA game."
,"Lou Williams scores 24 points in loss: He's officially hot again after scoring 26 points in his previous outing. Williams started the last game with Luol Deng (wrist) out, but the Lakers went with Brandon Ingram in the first unit this time around and it will likely stick. Williams still logged 31 minutes because he helped the Lakers climb back into this game, adding seven assists, four rebounds and two triples. He won't be this good going forward and he's a candidate to be moved before the trade deadline, but he's worth owning right now and is giving Eric Gordon a run for his money for the Sixth Man of the Year Award."
,"Jameer Nelson comes back to earth Tuesday: He was probably a popular DFS play with Gary Harris out again, but he was strictly the backup point guard tonight. He had 18 points, four boards, four assists and two 3-pointers on Monday against his former team (Magic), but wasn't feeling quite as motivated tonight. Will Barton was awesome tonight and is the guy you want to target as long as Gary Harris is out with his ankle injury."
,"Brandon Ingram stuffs the stat sheet in loss: This was arguably one of his best games as a pro. Ingram finished 6-of-14 from the field and 1-of-2 from the line with zero turnovers. With Luol Deng (wrist) out indefinitely, Ingram is looking at 30+ minutes per night moving forward. We'd like to see him do it again because he was averaging 10.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.7 blocks and 1.0 3-pointer in his previous nine January games, and there are a couple of better fantasy pickups around the league including Raymond Felton and Austin Rivers. If those guys are unavailable, give Ingram a look, but expect some bumps in the road."
,"Will Barton scores 26 in start for Harris: It's too bad the Nuggets can't play the Lakers every night, right? Barton was aggressive and looked fantastic, and it's time for the Nuggets to think about starting him over Harris, even when Harris is healthy. Barton was iffy coming into this one with the flu, but played in his last game and was never really in doubt for this one. And as long as Harris is out, Barton's worth using in any format. He scored 21 on Monday with seven boards and three 3-pointers."
,"Jordan Clarkson (ankle) scores 19 points: He was considered questionable to play with a right ankle sprain, but you wouldn't have been able to tell by the way he was moving tonight. Clarkson added three assists, two steals and two triples in 36 minutes, and he saw a massive workload because he sparked a comeback attempt along with Ivica Zubac. Clarkson has been a headache to own this season in a crowded backcourt, but he's hot again with averages of 17.5 points, 2.2 assists and 1.3 3-pointers over his last four games. He should be more involved going forward with the Lakers sliding in the standings."
,"Kenneth Faried hits 9-of-10 shots vs. Lakers: Faried has been all over the place for most of his career and even left this game to have his back looked at, but soon returned. He's starting and rolling right now, averaging 18.3 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.0 steals on an amazing 25-of-30 shooting over his last three games. More shots at the rim please! Faried has carved out a spot in the starting lineup going forward and even though he was helped by the absence of Darrell Arthur (knee) tonight, Faried looks like a must-start in all formats right now."
,"Ivica Zubac scores 11 w/ 13 boards, 3 blocks: He also added one steal and one assist and sparked a comeback attempt that fell just short. The rookie was very impressive during the summer league and he's been lighting it up in the D-League as well, and coach Luke Walton has been talking about finding him more minutes. Zubac made just 10 brief appearances prior to Tuesday, but he should get a lot more opportunities to play in the second half of the season with the Lakers sitting in 14th place in the West with a 15-30 record. He looks like a great stash for the second half of the season."
,"Nikola Jokic racks up 29 points, 15 rebounds: The Lakers are pretty bad against opposing bigs and Jokic took advantage tonight. He's absolutely crushing right now, scoring 29 and 30 points in each of his last two games, and averaging 25 points, 11.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.0 3-pointers over his last five games, while shooting a ridiculous 65 percent from the floor and 76 percent from the line. He might be the most underrated fantasy player in the land right now."
,"Tarik Black (left ankle) plays well Tuesday: He was averaging just 6.1 points and 5.1 rebounds in 16.0 minutes in his previous nine January games, so it's hard not to call this a fluke. Coach Luke Walton likes to ride the hot hand off the bench and Black had it tonight, finishing 7-of-13 from the field. As impressive as this was, Black can be left on the wire in most leagues unless he does this again."
,"Kenneth Faried (back) returns to game: He was considered questionable to return after leaving the game in the third quarter due to tightness in his lower back, but he appears to be fine out there. We'll have another update after the game."
,"Gorgui Dieng blocks four shots in loss: He only played 29 minutes because coach Tom Thibodeau is starting to have more trust in Nemanja Bjelica due to his ability to stretch the floor late in games. However, Dieng is still producing at a high level and was coming off a 21-point game on Sunday. The presence of Bjelica is annoying, but Dieng's owners shouldn't be too concerned."
,"Shabazz Muhammad scores 15 in 23 mins: A report by Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical indicated that the Wolves are looking to include Muhammad in a package deal with Ricky Rubio, so he could be on his way to a new city before the Feb. 23 trade deadline. Considering coach Tom Thibodeau likes to give all his starters 30+ minutes a night, a move away from Minnesota might not be a bad thing. With that said, Muhammad is just a pure scorer and has very little upside in standard leagues."
,"Karl-Anthony Towns scores 27 points in loss: Towns has made an effort to find his shot earlier in games and it's paying dividends, as he's averaging 11.4 points in the first quarter of his last five games. 'Just wanted to do what I can to get us Ws and make it as easy as I can for us as a whole to try to get wins,' Towns said. 'I felt that me being more aggressive in the first quarter would help us a little more, and Im glad that its been working so far. Ill keep riding the train.' If he keeps this up, Towns should be a top-10 option the rest of the way."
,"Ricky Rubio scores 21 w/ 14 assists: He set new career highs in free throws made (13) and attempted (14), so that's not a bad way to respond to the trade rumors. The Wolves are actively shopping Rubio according to The Vertical and the Kings are a rumored destination, but that would actually be a decent spot for him in terms of fantasy value. His owners should sit tight until we learn more, but it sounds like there's a decent chance that he's moved before the Feb. 23 deadline. There are a lot of teams in need of an upgrade at the point, so there's no need to panic if you own him."
,"Pau Gasol plays 17 minutes in win: Incredibly, Gasol had the highest offensive rating in the NBA in his previous 10 games despite scoring in single digits in four of them. He was coming off a three-point dud on Saturday vs. the Suns, but his owners can expect him to bounce back on Thursday vs. the Nuggets -- Gasol scored 17 points with nine rebounds, four assists and two blocks vs. Denver on Jan. 5."
,"Wesley Matthews hits game-winner, plays D: While it may seem strange to praise Matthews' defense on a guy who just missed a triple-double with 24 points, nine boards and 12 assists (Butler), the two players had a running dialogue all night and Matthews had the last laugh when he knocked the ball away from Butler with the game on the line. Matthews finished with just 11 points, four rebounds, two assists and three 3-pointers, but was much better in real life than fantasy tonight. And the Mavericks have quietly won three straight games."
,"Patty Mills (left calf tightness) scores 11: His injury is minor and it sounds like he was rested against the Suns on Saturday. He saw a couple minutes less than normal tonight, but was still productive with four assists, one rebound and three triples on 4-of-10 shooting. Tony Parker is playing better these days, so he's the PG you want to own in San Antonio unlike earlier in the season. We'll let you know when that changes."
,"Rajon Rondo fading, scores zero Tuesday: Rondo is fading fast, hasn't scored more than six points in any of his last four games, and is averaging just 3.5 points, 2.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 0.5 steals over his last four games, while hitting just 6-of-25 shots over that stretch. There are simply better players to spend your time and effort on than Rondo right now, but he's probably still worth holding in deeper leagues."
,"LaMarcus Aldridge scores 29 in win over MIN: Aldridge was coming off a rough three-game stretch in which he averaged 13.7 points per game, but got back on track tonight. He grabbed four rebounds with three assists and two blocks, finishing 5-of-6 from the free throw line. He should be able to build off this momentum in a favorable matchup vs. the Nuggets on Thursday -- Aldridge dropped 28 points against the Nuggets on Jan. 5."
,"Doug McDermott turns into pumpkin Tuesday: McBuckets finally got hot on Sunday, hitting 9-of-16 shots for a season-high 31 points, six rebounds and three 3-pointers, but turned back into a pumpkin on Tuesday night. If you throw out his 31-point explosion, he hasn't scored more than eight points in his last five games and hit just 10-of-41 shots in those games. Maybe Sunday's game will eventually get him going, but it certainly didn't happen tonight against the Mavs. He's still a borderline player to own in 12-team leagues."
,"Nikola Mirotic plays 22 minutes in return: Not a bad line from Mirotic, who also benefitted from the absence of Taj Gibson, who was out with an ankle injury. The song remains the same with Miro - he'll have some big games and some bad games, so catching him on the right night can be tough. But if Gibson's ankle injury lingers, Mirotic will be someone worth picking up, while he could also bounce back for a decent second half, with or without Gibson. Mirotic is the textbook definition of a borderline player to own in 12-team leagues."
,"Kawhi Leonard scores 34 w/ 7 boards, 5 dimes: He's unfair. This was Leonard's 12th 30-point game of the season and his fourth in a row, becoming the first Spur to score 30+ points in four straight since Tim Duncan in Jan. 2004. The Claw added seven rebounds, five assists, one steal and two triples, and he also finished 8-of-9 from the free throw line. There's no reason why he shouldn't be a top-5 option in standard leagues the rest of the way."
,"Dwyane Wade scores 17, can't hit winner: Wade picked up a deflection after Wesley Matthews nearly stole the ball from Jimmy Butler and got a good look at the game-winning shot at the buzzer over Deron Williams, but it wasn't meant to be. Wade is a fine play on nights he's actually playing, But he had missed two of his previous four games coming into this one. The Bulls have another back-to-back this Friday and Saturday, and then again on Tuesday and Wednesday, so owners can only pray that he plays in more than two of those four games."
,"Robin Lopez has best game as Bull Tuesday: Ro-Lo has been pretty quiet this season with the Bulls, but broke out of a funk tonight. Some more rebounds and blocks would have been nice, but owners will take this one. It probably helped that he was facing a Mavs' team starting ancient forward Dirk Nowitzki at center, so we'll have to see if Ro-Lo can do it again on Friday against Dwight Howard and the Hawks, which will be a tougher test."
,"Paul Zipser starts, scores five points: Zipser will likely move to the bench regardless of Gibson's ankle, as Nikola Mirotic is back in action for the Bulls after dealing with an illness. Forget about him in fantasy."
,"Jimmy Butler just misses triple-double: Butler has been back for three games since dealing with an illness and hasn't missed a beat. He also hasn't committed more than three turnovers in any of his last three games, which adds to his stellar efficiency rating."
,"J.J. Barea goes for 12 & 6 off bench: Barea's hit double digits in back-to-back games but will need more than the 17 minutes he's getting a night right now if he's going to be worth adding in fantasy. Just keep an eye on him, as he's starting to come on."
,"Seth Curry scores 18 in another start at SG: Curry could stick in the starting lineup going forward, while Dirk Nowitzki got the start at center tonight. Curry hasn't done anything too spectacular recently, but is averaging 9.0 points, 1.8 steals and 1.8 3-pointers. If Curry sticks with the starters he should be fun to own the rest of the way, despite the occasional quiet night."
,"Terrence Ross scores 15 w/ three triples: With Kyle Lowry resting, Ross had more responsibility tonight and made the most of it, hitting 6-of-11 from the field and 3-of-7 from beyond the arc in 30 minutes. Ross has scored 15, 12 and 12 points in his last three games with a combined nine 3-pointers in that span, but it's tough to trust him in standard leagues when the Raptors are at full strength."
,"Deron Williams packs stat sheet in win: Harrison Barnes scored 20 and Dirk Nowitzki had a 10 & 10 double-double in the win, and Williams has scored in double figures in four straight games. He's averaging 13 points, 4.2 rebounds, 8.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.8 3-pointers on 48 percent shooting over his last five and should be owned in all leagues right now."
,"Fred VanVleet scores 10 points in win: Kyle Lowry (rest) got the night off, so VanVleet was the backup PG behind Cory Joseph in this one. He played 25 minutes and added four rebounds, two assists, two steals and two 3-pointers, but he's usually not in the rotation when the Raptors are healthy. It's safe to leave him on the wire, but it's good to know that the rookie has some talent."
,"Cory Joseph scores career-high 33 points: Starting in place of the resting Kyle Lowry, Joseph shattered his previous career high of 20 points set back in 2014. He hit 15-of-22 shots from the field with four rebounds, four assists and one triple in 37 minutes, as the Nets' young backcourt had no answer for him. Lowry is expected to return on Wednesday vs. the 76ers, but remember this performance from CoJo the next time Lowry gets a night off."
,"Wayne Ellington scores 18 points in win: He's getting some extra burn with Josh Richardson (foot) sidelined and made the most of it in tonight's 28 minutes. However, he hadn't played more than 20 minutes in his previous four games and scored a grand total of 16 points in those. Maybe this will get him some more consistent playing time going forward, but he's still not a must-own player. Just keep an eye on him if you need 3-pointers."
,"DeMar DeRozan goes off for 36 points: Kyle Lowry (rest) got the night off and DeRozan's usage rate climbs from 31.7 to 41.5 with Lowry off the court, so it's no surprise that he feasted on the Nets. He added 11 rebounds, six assists and one steal, hitting all 10 of his free throws. He didn't even attempt a 3-pointer, but that only makes this line even more impressive. Just make sure he's active for Wednesday's matchup vs. the 76ers on the second night of a back-to-back set."
,"James Johnson fills stat sheet again for Heat: He didn't have a block and committed five turnovers, but he's basically putting up some variation of this line, minus the TOs, every night. He's a must-own player for the time being."
,"Willie Reed scores 2 points in 16 minutes: He was all the fantasy rage when Hassan Whiteside was out with an eye injury, but Whiteside is back and had 14 points and 15 rebounds tonight, rendering Reed useless. At least for now."
,"Dion Waiters hits 7-of15 shots for 17 points: Waiters has been in an ugly shooting slump and missed some layups tonight, but looked much better than he has over his previous four games, when he hit just 15-of-53 shots. He's locked and loaded at shooting guard with Josh Richardson out for the next couple weeks, making him a hot pickup in fantasyland."
,"Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scores 14 points: This was his second game in a row with 14 points, but he played 26 minutes this time compared to 17 on Sunday. He also added eight rebounds, three assists, one block and one steal in one of his better games of the season. A recent report by Zack Lowe of ESPN indicated that the Nets are 'willing' to listen to offers for the second-year wing, but he's one of the few building blocks on the roster and a move away from Brooklyn would likely be a bad thing for his value -- he has a great path to extended minutes on the Nets. To be clear, a trade seems very unlikely and RHJ looks like a nice stash for the second half of the season."
,"Goran Dragic flirts with triple-double in win: The six turnovers were weird and matched James Harden's output in that category, but the rest of his game was stellar, as usual. As long as Dragic isn't traded, he should continue to rack up gaudy stats for the Heat."
,"Brandon Ingram will start on Tuesday: Luol Deng (wrist) is considered out indefinitely, so the rookie is looking at a hefty workload going forward. As a starter this season, Ingram has posted averages of 9.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 0.6 blocks and 0.7 triples in 11 games. We'll let you know how he fares tonight."
,"Sam Dekker plays 25 minutes in loss: He saw some extra minutes with Ryan Anderson out with an illness, but will return to his normal (read: fewer) minutes with Anderson due back quickly from the flu."
,"Eric Gordon has one of those nights in loss: Ouch. He left the game briefly to have either his ankle or toe re-taped, but never got into a groove tonight. And with Ryan Anderson out with the flu, the Rockets were looking for him to step up. Hopefully his re-taping issue is not a problem going forward and we expect him to bounce back on Wednesday against the Bucks. That is a back-to-back situation and coach Mike D'Antoni said after the game he's a little worried about whether Gordon will be ready to bounce back. Watch for news on Gordon on Wednesday, just in case."
,"Justin Hamilton returns to bench, scores 9: That's an impressive stat line in limited minutes, but Hamilton usually doesn't have much value while Brook Lopez is active. Lopez did tweak his right ankle in the loss, so put Hamilton on your radar in case Lopez misses Friday's game vs. the Pelicans."
,"Montrezl Harrell plays 16 minutes on Tuesday: Clint Capela started, but played just nine minutes, while Harrell and Nene handled the center minutes off the bench. Nene had four points and seven rebounds in 24 minutes, but both players are going to take a hit once Capela gets his body back in NBA shape after missing 15 games with a broken leg. If you are ready to drop Harrell, it makes sense."
,"Clint Capela fails to score in return: The good news is that he's back and the bad news is that it will be baby steps for Capela as he works his way back into game shape. He's worth holding, but it may be a week or so before we see him return to form. He did have five rebounds and a block, for what it's worth."
,"Brook Lopez scores 28, tweaks right ankle: Lopez had a slight limp on the next couple plays, but he was moving better and better as the fourth quarter progressed. There's a chance that his ankle will swell up on him overnight, but luckily he gets a few days of rest before Friday's game vs. the Pelicans. Lopez added eight rebounds, two assists and two blocks on 11-of-23 shooting from the field and 6-of-6 from the line. If you're in a deep league, handcuffing him with Justin Hamilton isn't a bad idea. For what it's worth, Lopez said he felt 'fine' after the game."
,"Corey Brewer fizzles again in start: He's been awful as a starter (or otherwise) this season and was averaging just 3.8 points in his six previous starts. Anderson should be back soon, so Brewer's time as a starter should be short lived."
,"LeVert scores 14 w/ 4 assists and 2 steals: The rookie struggled with foul trouble in the first half, but came out firing in the third quarter with a couple treys. He finished 6-of-8 from the field with one turnover, and coach Kenny Atkinson wasn't hesitant to put him on DeMar DeRozan on the defensive end. He's been great in limited minutes, but it feels like it's just a matter of time before he takes Joe Harris' spot in the first unit. LeVert looks like a solid stash for the second half of the season on a Nets' team that should prioritize player development. For what it's worth, LeVert led the team with a +/- rating of +9 in the double-digit loss."
,"Luol Deng (wrist) ruled out indefinitely: This came out of nowhere, but he apparently suffered the injury two days ago and he was sporting a huge wrap on his wrist prior to being ruled out. Look for Brandon Ingram to get some extra run in his absence, while Thomas Robinson could also see a small boost. Deng has a history of wrist problems so it will be interesting to see how long this one keeps him out."
,"Gary Harris (ankle) out for Nuggets: Will Barton (flu) is available and it would be surprising if both he and Jameer Nelson don't make some noise tonight in Harris' absence."
,"Will Barton (illness) will start Tuesday: He was listed as probable, but he's looking at a lot of minutes in the absence of Gary Harris (ankle), making him a popular play in DFS. The Nuggets play three more times this week after tonight, so pick Barton up if he's available."
,"Danilo Gallinari and Will Barton will play: Both players were listed as probable, but they are ready to roll in a favorable matchup vs. the Lakers. Get them active and check back after the game for an update."
,"Eric Gordon leaves, then returns for Rockets: He likely either aggravated his toe injury or suffered a sprained ankle, but whatever the case, he had it taped back up and is back in the game. He's having a tough night, currently sitting on seven points on 3-of-11 shooting."
,"Tarik Black (left ankle) is available: He's averaging 15.8 minutes over his last five games, so he shouldn't be on most fantasy rosters."
,"Nogueira (blurred vision) done for night: He has blurred vision in his left eye and will be re-evaluated again after the game. He was also being evaluated for a concussion, but we should know more about that soon. Paskal Siakam started the second half and Jakop Poeltl could play a bit more as well. Bebe finished with three points (a trey) and two rebounds in seven minutes. There are no great speculative pickups here."
,"Lucas Nogueira (head) goes to locker room: He is undergoing the concussion protocol in the locker room, so hopefully we'll know more very soon. He easily walked off under his own power and looked OK, but don't make any roster moves until we know more. He had three points (a trey) and two rebounds in seven minutes before heading for the locker room."
,"Austin Rivers looking at an increased role: Rivers was going to lose some value with Blake Griffin (knee) nearing a return, but not so fast. With Paul out, both Rivers and Felton could realistically play over 30 minutes a night even with a healthy Blake. Rivers is averaging 16.8 points, 4.5 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.8 triples in January, and his usage rate climbs from 14.9 to 21.8 when Paul is off the court. Go pick him up."
,"Raymond Felton looking at a bump in minutes: Felton started the second half of Monday's game and looked great with 15 points on 7-of-7 shooting with six assists, three rebounds, one block, one steal and two turnovers in 27 minutes, and he averaged 10.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.8 steals and 0.7 triples in six previous starts this season. He's likely going to take over the starting role in Los Angeles and looks like a strong pickup in standard leagues. Austin Rivers also looks like a great pickup."
,"Brook Lopez is starting for the Nets Tuesday: He's good to go and should have a decent matchup against the Raptors tonight."
,"Cory Joseph starting for Lowry (rest): Lowry is getting the night off to rest some bumps and bruises, so Joseph could eclipse the 30-minute mark tonight and looks like a strong punt in DFS. DeMar DeRozan should also be a popular play, as his usage rate climbs from 31.7 to 41.5 with Lowry off the court."
,"Kyle Lowry (rest) will not play Tuesday: Nothing like a very late and unexpected lineup change involving a stud to send DFS players scrambling at the last minute... The Raps announced that 'Lowry will dress but likely not play to rest bumps/bruises.' Safe to assume that playing the last-place Nets factored into Toronto's thought process, in addition to the fact that this is the front-end of a back-to-back for the Raps. Cory Joseph will replace Lowry in the lineup on Tuesday. Lowry should be ready to roll on Wednesday."
,"Chris Paul (thumb surgery) out 6-8 weeks: This is a brutal blow for the Clippers. With this report, we likely won't see Paul back until March at the earliest. Luckily, that's just in time for the fantasy playoffs. Raymond Felton and Austin Rivers will both benefit and look like great pickups in standard leagues."
,"Steven Adams (concussion) out Wednesday: He's still going through the league mandated concussion protocol testing, and he won't be able to return until he clears all the necessary steps. Because the Warriors like to play small, Jerami Grant could be looking at another start sans Adams, and Enes Kanter should see his minutes closer to the 30-minute mark. After Wednesday, the Thunder don't play again until Monday vs. the Jazz, so this might only end up being a two-game absence for Adams."
,"Patrick Patterson (knee) out Tuesday vs. BKN: This will be his third straight game on the sidelines, and his absence essentially ensures that Lucas Nogueira will get another start at the four-spot. Nogueira is worth owning as a shot blocking specialist in most leagues, while Patterson isn't worth a roster spot almost anywhere."
,"Paul Zipser to start in place of Taj Gibson: Zipser has started two games previously this season. In those two starts, he is averaging 6.0 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 24.6 minutes. Thus, there is no need to add Zipser off the wire, and he is even risky as a streaming option or a DFS punt.
"
,"Gibson (ankle) out, Zipser likely to start: Zipser only saw 15 minutes of action in his previous start, so we wouldn't get too hyped up about him sticking in the starting five. Nikola Mirotic (illness) will be returning from a four-game absence today, and it'll likely be him and Doug McDermott splitting the majority of Gibson's minutes. Fred Hoiberg described Gibson's absence as precautionary and said it's unlikely that he'll need to undergo an MRI, so chances are he'll be able to return to the court for Friday's game in Atlanta."
,"Corey Brewer will start on Tuesday: Brewer has started six games for the Rockets this season; however, his stats in those starts are not encouraging. He is averaging 3.8 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 18.6 minutes over those six contests. Brewer's overall numbers are down in 2016-17. He is averaging 4.1 points and has scored more than 10 points just once all season. He should see 20-plus minutes tonight but is still a risky play even as DFS punt."
,"Okaro White may play for Miami on Tuesday: The Heat literally just signed White this afternoon. However, being shorthanded due to injuries has really forced Miami's hand. In addition, White spent training camp and much of the preseason with Miami, so he should be familiar with some of Miami basic sets. He can be left on waiver wires for now, but deep-league GM's will want to keep an eye on the situation in case White does, in fact, crack the rotation."
,"Ryan Anderson (illness) ruled out for Tuesday: Corey Brewer will move into the starting five sans Anderson, with Trevor Ariza shifting over to the four-spot, and both James Harden and Eric Gordon will see an uptick to their respective usage rates. Tuesday will be the first game of a back-to-back set, so Anderson doesn't have much time to rest up for Wednesday's game against the Bucks. For now we'll be considering him questionable, and his owners will need to check back for another update closer to Wednesday's tip."
,"Jeremy Lin (hamstring) out Tuesday vs. TOR: He's out indefinitely, and we're going to stop updating his status until he clears some sort of benchmark for getting back to the court (he's still not practicing). Isaiah Whitehead and Spencer Dinwiddie will continue to man the point guard position in Lin's absence, but neither guy is worth a roster spot in most settings."
,"Omri Casspi (calf) set to miss 1-2 weeks: Casspi randomly moves in and out of the rotation in Sacramento, so this injury won't have any major consequences in fantasy hoops."
,"Ed Davis (ankle) out Wednesday vs. Hornets: Davis only lasted five minutes on Monday night before the ankle flared up on him, so he could be spending a few games on the shelf here as he gets his ankle back to 100 percent. Meyers Leonard and Noah Vonleh will likely split Davis' minutes, but that means very little in fantasy hoops."
,"MIN views Kris Dunn as long-term starter: The Vertical broke news on Tuesday that Minnesota is actively shopping Ricky Rubio with the intent of being able to eventually turn over the reins to Dunn, so its highly likely that the rookie will be unleashed towards the end of the year. That being said, Dunn has a shaky jumper (37.8 percent shooting) and is not capable of consistently hitting the 3-point shot (0.4), so those two things will likely keep his value in check even when he's getting 30 minutes a night. Still, his upside in steals and assists makes him a reasonable guy to stash in deep leagues."
,"Report: Wolves actively shopping Ricky Rubio: The Wolves are reportedly trying to package Rubio and Shabazz Muhammad in order to bring in another guard that would initially start, but eventually, accept a backup role behind Minnesota's No. 5 overall pick Kris Dunn. Thus far the Kings have been the only team to express strong interest in acquiring Rubio, but the Wolves don't like what they can offer, and there's reportedly no traction between those two clubs on the trade front. It's tough to predict what Rubio's outlook will look like on another team, but this report firmly puts Dunn on the radar as a quality deep league stash."
,"Mike Muscala (ankle) out Wednesday vs. DET: Muscala's minutes will likely be divvied up between Kris Humphries and Mike Scott, but neither of those guys will get enough run to matter in most settings while Paul Millsap and Dwight Howard are healthy."
,"Bismack Biyombo (knee) questionable vs. NO: Biyombo had a really nasty fall on Monday, and while he played through it, it looks like the injury swelled up on him on the flight over to New Orleans. If Biyombo can't give it a go on Wednesday night, Nikola Vucevic would likely see his minutes rise to the high-30s, and Aaron Gordon may be able to spend some more time at the four-spot. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround."
,"Fournier, Biyombo questionable for Wednesday: Fournier missed five straight games with this same injury earlier this month, and that wasn't enough time off to get himself right, so he could miss more time this time around. Considering he's only sat out the past two, we feel he's much closer to doubtful for Wednesday's game, but we should get another update after shootaround. Biyombo had a nasty fall on Monday, and while he played through it, it looks like the knee swelled up on the flight to New Orleans."
,"Demetrius Jackson sent down to D-League: Neat."
,"Report: Anthony, Jackson discuss future in NY: A source of Ramona Shelburne described the meeting as 'far more contentious' than previous sit downs, and it looks like things in New York are reaching a boiling point with the Knicks falling out of the playoff hunt, and a Jackson confidant Charley Rosen recently publishing an extremely negative piece on Melo stating he's 'outlived his usefulness in New York.' Time and again Melo has stated that his desire is to remain with the Knicks and that he's not interested in waiving his no-trade clause, and neither of those sentiments changed during Tuesday's meeting."
,"Steven Adams listed as out for Wednesday: To be clear, this report is coming from the game notes, which are notoriously unreliable, so we'd recommend checking back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround. Jerami Grant got the start in his place on Monday night vs. the Clippers, although the game was a massive blowout, so head coach Billy Donovan might want to rethink that strategy. If Adams can't give it a go on Wednesday, both Grant and Enes Kanter should see an uptick in minutes. Stay tuned."
,"Jeremy Lamb (foot) ruled out for Wednesday: Wednesday will mark Lamb's third straight game on the sidelines, and it's currently unclear exactly when he'll be able to get back to the court. Lamb typically isn't a major part of the rotation while the team is at full strength, so there aren't any major fantasy implications here. Marco Belinelli will have the opportunity for some extended minutes, but that's about it."
,"Kristaps Porzingis could return Wednesday: Head coach Jeff Hornacek also hinted that he'd like to start Porzingis at center with Carmelo Anthony moving to the four-spot, a move that would result in Joakim Noah going to the bench, and that demotion likely wouldn't go over very well with the underperforming 31-year-old center who is due $17 million this season. The losses in New York have been piling up as of late, so Hornacek needs to make some changes, even if it upsets the veterans."
,"Miami gives 10-day contract to Okaro White: 'The way everything is shaking out right now, we really needed another guy of his skill set,' coach Erik Spoelstra said of the Heat's injury situation. 'Another defender, long, can guard multiple positions. Just the way the season has been going, everybody has to be ready.' White will get a chance to impress Miami during his 10-day contract, but GMs in most leagues can view this situation with a wait-and-see approach."
,"Larry Nance unlikely to return this week: Nance recently went through some 1-on-1 work with Ivica Zubac, but he's still yet to go through a full practice with the team, and until that happens he won't be getting back to the court. As long as Nance is on the sidelines, Julius Randle will continue to see his playing time in the mid-30s."
,"Anthony Davis (hip, thumb) questionable Weds: Davis hit the ground hard on Monday, and given that he tends to be a slow healer, we feel he's probably a bit closer to doubtful for Wednesday's game. If he's out, Terrence Jones would likely move back into the starting five, and there would be more minutes available for Donatas Motiejunas, while Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans would be tasked with more offensive responsibilities. Check back for another update following Wednesday morning's shootaround."
,"Tyler Zeller (illness) won't play Wednesday: Zeller was able to get through a full practice on Tuesday, so while he'll miss Wednesday's game, there's a chance he'll be able to return to action Saturday vs. Portland. That being said, Zeller is a negligible part of the rotation in Boston, so his return to action won't have any meaningful impact in fantasy hoops."
,"Tarik Black (ankle) expected to play Tuesday: He was a full participant during shootaround, so he should be out there tonight. However, Black is only averaging 5.8 points and 5.1 rebounds per game this season, so his playing status is largely irrelevant in fantasy hoops."
,"Clarkson, Black expected to play on Tuesday: Both guys were active at shootaround, and this ankle injury for Clarkson seemingly came out of nowhere (he hasn't missed any games because of it), so owners can go ahead and get him on the active roster. We'll have official confirmation closer to tip-off."
,"Will Barton (illness) probable for Tuesday: Barton if fully expected to play on Tuesday, just as he did Monday night (logging 24 minutes off the bench), when he was also listed as probable. Gary Harris (ankle) is listed as doubtful, which means there is a chance Barton slides into the starting lineup on Tuesday. Barton has started 14 games this season and is averaging 14.2 points, 5.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists in those 14 contests. He is a intriquing DFS option is Harris is ruled out"
,"Gallinari (ankle) probable for Wednesday: Gallinari has been battling a nagging ankle injury for over a week now, but it has not limited his playing time. In fact, Gallo played a game-high 40 minutes in Monday's win over the Magic. Don't hesitate to insert Gallinari in your starting lineup as usual. 

"
,"Aron Baynes (knee) does not practice Tuesday: Baynes injury appears to be minor, but if he does miss time Boban Marjanovic would be the primary beneficiary."
,"Darrell Arthur (knee) will not play Tuesday: This will be the third consecutive game Arthur has missed due to his latest knee pain. Kenneth Faried started and played a season-high 33 minutes on Monday. The Manimal will likely see extra minutes on Tuesday as well due to Arthur's absence."
,"Noel (ankle) expects to play Wednesday: 'It's still a little sore, but I definitely should be able to go [Wednesday],' said Noel after practice on Tuesday. Noel had been playing well prior to injuring his ankle on Saturday, which forced him to sit out Monday's game. If Noel is available, coach Brett Brown will have a tough decision to make. Does he send Jahlil Okafor back to the bench to collect DNP-CD's, or limit Noel's minutes as the sole center on the second unit? Stay tuned..."
,"Embiid to remain on 28-min limit all season: When asked if there was a possibility that the team would increase Embiid's minute cap or remove the limit altogether, Brown said: 'I don't believe there is.' Fantasy owners would obviously love to see The Process play more, but they obviously can't complain about the results thus far. The Sixers are wisely playing it safe with their franchise cornerstone, who has been consistently spectacular all season long."
,"Jahlil Okafor (ankle) probable for Wednesday: Okafor has played in each of the Sixers last two contests (the first time he has played in consecutive since late December) due to Joel Embiid resting on Saturday and Nerlens Noel (ankle) missing Monday's game. Okafor has 'some soreness' in his ankle, but is expected to be healthy enough to play on Wednesday. Noel is currently questionable for Wednesday, so Okafor could again see significant minutes if Noel is sidelined."
,"Joel Embiid (rest) probable for Wednesday: Embiid is coming off yet another monster game on Monday, finishing with 22 points, 12 rebounds, two assists, and five blocks. He has now scored at least 20 points in nine straight games, tying the NBA's all-time record for longest streak with at least 20 points while playing fewer than 30 minutes in each contest. As always, Trust The Process."
,"T.J. McConnell (wrist) will try to play Wed: McConnell missed Monday's game after spraining his right wrist on Saturday. He has been fitted with a splint and will attempt to give it a go. We will likely have to wait until after pre-game warm-ups on Wednesday before we get official word. For what it's worth, he is listed as doubtful in the game notes. If T.J. can't play, Sergio Rodriguez will likely draw the start, with rookie Chasson Randle seeing minutes off the bench."
,"Jon Leuer (knee) practices on Tuesday: Leuer has missed each of the Pistons last four games, but is obviously close to a return. He is expected to be listed as questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Atlanta. With Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (shoulder) sidelined, Leuer may be in line to see additional minutes if he plays and is healthy enough to handle them when he returns."
,"Andre Drummond (knee) misses practice Tuesday: Drummond sprained his knee on Sunday, which caused him to leave the game for a brief period. However, he did return, finishing with 15 points and 17 rebounds in 32 minutes. It sounds like the absence from Tuesday's practice is purely precautionary, as Pistons beat writer Rod Beard tweeted that Drummond is 'fine.' Thus, we expect Drummond to suit up Wednesday vs. the Hawks."
,"Gorgui Dieng (illness) back at practice Tues: Dieng is expected to be ready to roll on Tuesday night when the Wolves play the Spurs. Dieng is coming off one of his best games of the season, when he lit up the Mavs for a season high-21 points on 10-of-12 shooting and eight rebounds on Sunday.

"
,"Caldwell-Pope (shoulder) misses practice Tues: KCP has been diagnosed with a Grade-2 left rotator cuff strain. He is expected to be listed as questionable for Sunday when the Pistons release their game notes. Stanley Johnson has seen a big boost in playing time with Caldwell-Pope on the shelf. Johnson is averaging 9.0 points, 3.0 assists and 2.0 rebounds in 32.6 minutes over the Pistons last three games."
,"Nets assign Chris McCullough to D-League: McCullough is not a part of the Nets rotation and has no fantasy relevance."
,"HOU's backup center will be based on matchups: 'Maybe the first guy off the bench will be a matchup consideration. Or if bulky centers give Clint a problem, I'll substitute early and get Nene in there. Or if we need energy today, maybe here comes Montrezl,' said coach D'Antoni. Harrell averaged 14.6 points (on 68.3 percent shooting) and 4.9 rebounds in 27.4 minutes over the 14 games Capela missed due to his knee injury, but will obviously see a big hit to his playing time and production serving solely as a reserve."
,"Nikola Mirotic (illness) will play Tuesday: Mirotic, who has missed four straight games due to strep throat, has been a disappointment this season, averaging career-lows in points (9.5), assists (0.8), field goal percentage (.387), 3-point percentage (.312) and free-throw percentage (.758). Hopefully, he can bounce back in the second half of the season to salvage his 2016-17 campaign. Mirotic's return will cut into Doug McDermott's minutes and likely knock Bobby Portis out of the rotation."
,"Willie Reed (sternum) will play Tuesday: Outside of the four games Reed started when Hassan Whiteside was sidelined, Reed is averaging 11.9 minutes as a reserve in the 28 games he has played off the Miami bench this season. Reed's return could cut into James Johnson's minutes, as Miami wouldn't need JJ to backup Whiteside."
,"Ryan Anderson (illness) doubtful for Tuesday: After playing at least 32 minutes in each of the Rockets first seven games in January, Anderson's minutes have dipped a bit of late. He played just 25 minutes last Friday and then 23 on Sunday. As it turns out, it is because he has been fighting the flu for the last few days. If Anderson is unable to play on Tuesday, Corey Brewer, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell and Trevor Ariza would likely divvy up his playing time. Clint Capela is also slated to return on Tuesday, so that will help fill the frontcourt void left by Anderson."
,"Clint Capela (knee) will start Tuesday night: Capela will return after missing 15 games. Coach Mike D'Antoni indicated that there will not be a minutes cap in place, but did say: 'His condition being what it is, we'll keep him under 20 minutes, probably.' Capela was averaging 24.5 minutes per game over Houston's first 28 games this season. Montrezl Harrell had played relatively well in Capela absence, but will now get bumped back to the bench."
,"Kelly Olynyk's aggressive play keys C's wins: Olynyk had offseason surgery that kept him from participating in full basketball activities for the better part of six months. He is finally working his way back into optimal shape and has played well of late. He has scored at least 12 points in four of the Celtics last five games and has 41 points, 17 boards and six 3-pointers over his last two games. There is a chance he gets promoted to Boston's starting lineup, as coach Brad Stevens said, ' I think hes a good fit with Al (Horford).' 
"
,"Clint Capela (knee) expected to play Tuesday: 'I've been doing pretty good in the workouts by myself, sprinting, dunking. It all felt good,' Capela said. He had been playing the best basketball of his career prior to the injury, which was initially projected to cost him 4-6 weeks. He is averaging 11.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.6 blocks - all career-highs. Make sure he is not floating around your league's waiver wire, as he was returning mid-round value over the first two months of the season."
,"Jokic leads offensive revival in Denver: Over the last month, the Nuggets are top-10 in the league in field goals made, field goal accuracy, 3-point accuracy, 3-point field goals made. Jokic has been the centerpiece of the offense, and the engine driving them forward. Over his last 14 games, Jokic is averaging 19.2 points, 9.1 rebounds and 5.4 assists. He's been top-15 overall fantasy producer over this stretch. The sky is the limit for this kid over the second half of the season"
,"Darrell Arthur (knee): Tuesday status unknown: Arthur missed his second consecutive game due to left knee soreness on Monday. He has missed a total of 10 games this season as a result of knee issues. 'He only knows one speed,' coach Mike Malone said. 'When we (practice) hard he goes hardest. And his knee has a hard time withstanding that pounding. So I almost have to try to protect him from himself at times.' Kenneth Faried played a season-high 33 minutes on Monday and would get a boost on Tuesday if Arthur is out."
,"Courtney Lee unsure if he will come off bench: '[Coach Jeff Hornacek] said it might just be for this game [Monday], it might be for a couple games. He was just saying we need to change something around,' Lee said after the Knicks lost to the Hawks on Monday afternoon. Lee played just 21 minutes and was benched the entire fourth quarter. He is averaging only 6.5 points and shooting just 19 percent from 3-point territory over his last six games."
,"Mavs D-League affiliate acquires DeJuan Blair: Blair played for the Wizards last season, but is not expected to have any fantasy impact in Dallas this year."
,"Gary Harris (ankle): X-rays are negative: Harris has played just 17 of the Nuggets 38 games this season due to a variety of groin and foot injuries, and it appears he will miss at least one more due to this ankle sprain. The good news is that this injury seems relatively minor. 'I dont think this is nearly as serious or severe as the previous injury,' coach Mike Malone said. Jameer Nelson and Will Barton will likely see a boost if Harris is unable to play."
,"Jameer Nelson enjoys victory over the Magic: Nelson left Orlando in 2014 but clearly isn't happy with the way the relationship ended. ''It just felt like certain people counted me out, but one thing Im never going to do is count myself out,' said Nelson. He finished with 18 points, four boards and four assists in 32 minutes on Monday. With Gary Harris (ankle) expected to miss Tuesday's game vs. the Lakers, Nelson could be in line for extra playing time on Tuesday as well"
,"Ty Lawson (ankle) probable for Wednesday: Lawson twisted his left ankle in the second half of the Sunday's game vs. OKC and was unable to return. However, it appears that the injury is minor and that Lawson 'isn't expecting to miss' the Kings next game, which is Wednesday vs. Indiana. Stay tuned for a formal update from the team regarding his status."
,"Enes Kanter scores 12 points in loss: Kanter was expected to draw the start with Steven Adams (concussion) out, but the Thunder opted to go small with Jerami Grant. Kanter added five rebounds with one assist, one steal and one block, but only played 23 minutes in the blowout. The Thunder only play one more time this week and it's against the Warriors, so it's worth noting that Kanter only played three minutes in their first meeting this season. He's been on fire in January, so we'd hope the Thunder will actually use him this time around."
,"Jerami Grant blocks three shots in start: Grant logged a team-high 34 minutes and added eight rebounds, one assist, three triples and three blocks, but the Thunder only play one more time this week against the Warriors on Wednesday. Unless you're looking to stream some blocks in that contest, it's best to leave Grant on the wire in standard leagues."
,"Russell Westbrook scores 24 points in loss: It's amazing that a line like this can actually be called an off night, but that's how good Westy has been this season. He's still averaging a triple-double on the year, so his owners have nothing to complain about. He gets a matchup with Kevin Durant and the Warriors on Wednesday, but he struggled in their first meeting with 20 points on 4-of-15 shooting. He will still be a recommended DFS target for obvious reasons."
,"J.J. Redick scores 20 with five triples: He shot 7-of-15 from the field in just 27 minutes, adding two assists, one rebound and two steals. Redick is rolling with averages of 19.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.6 steals and 3.8 triples over his last five games, but expect his numbers to take a hit when Blake Griffin (knee) returns in the near future. Chris Paul (sprained thumb) picked up an injury tonight, but Redick won't benefit as much if CP3 misses time because his usage rate, true shooting percentage and offensive rating are lower when CP3 isn't on the court."
,"Marreese Speights scores 23 w/ 10 boards: He scored 10 of his points in garbage time during the fourth quarter, but Speights was on fire all night, hitting 8-of-15 shots from the field and 4-of-4 from the line. Speights is a per-minute monster, but the problem is that he's only eclipsed the 20-minute mark one time in January (tonight). With Blake Griffin (knee) nearing a return, it's tough to get excited about this. We'll let you know if his role grows."
,"Austin Rivers scores 16 w/ six assists: He played impressive defense on Russell Westbrook and is thriving with the first unit. Rivers logged 35 minutes and added six assists, two rebounds, one steal and two triples, and he could have the ball in his hands a lot more if Chris Paul (sprained thumb) misses any time. Rivers' usage rate rises from 14.9 to 21.8 when Paul is off the court, so he looks like a solid pickup in addition to Raymond Felton."
,"Raymond Felton scores 15 on 7-of-7 shooting: Chris Paul left the game with a sprained left thumb and did not return, so Felton started the second half and  added six assists, three rebounds, one block, one steal and two turnovers in 27 minutes. X-rays were negative on Paul's thumb, but he is scheduled to have an MRI on Tuesday at which point we will know if he needs to miss additional time. Felton looks like a nice speculative pickup with averages of 10.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.8 steals and 0.7 triples in six previous starts this season."
,"Jordan scores 19 w/ 15 boards, 4 blocks: He was coming off a monster 24-point game with 21 rebounds and two blocks on Saturday, so it's not a surprise that he demolished a Thunder frontcourt that was missing Steven Adams (concussion). He finished 7-of-8 from the field and a respectable 5-of-8 from the line in 30 minutes. Jordan has recorded 20+ rebounds four times through seven January games, but he will have his hands full on Thursday vs. the Wolves. In their previous meeting on Nov. 12, Jordan posted 18 points, 16 rebounds and a pair of blocks of steals."
,"Alec Burks fizzles in nine minutes: Joe Ingles started for Rodney Hood (knee) and played well, and Joe Johnson was Joe Cool off the bench with 15 points and three 3-pointers, so Burks looks like the big loser in the Hood-injury sweepstakes. If you picked up Burks in hopes of a decent week, we'd recommend throwing him back and taking a flier on Ingles or Johnson, instead."
,"Joe Johnson scores 15 in Hood's absence: Johnson is getting extra run with Rodney Hood out for a couple weeks with a knee injury, although Joe Ingles is the new starter. Johnson scored 10 points in the fourth quarter and hit a huge 3-pointer to put the Jazz up one with just 42 seconds remaining. Johnson and the Jazz have two more games this week, so picking him (and/or Ingles) up might make sense, if you have someone you don't mind dropping."
,"George Hill tweaks ankle in win over Suns: He left late in the game with a sprained ankle, but it doesn't appear to be serious and he wasn't noticeably limping after the game. Injuries have been a huge problem for Hill this season, so check to make sure he's good to go against the Mavericks on Friday against the Mavericks. The good news is that he has a full three days to recover before Friday's game. If he's out, Shelvin Mack would benefit the most."
,"X-rays negative on Chris Paul's thumb: This is awesome news because it means we can rule out any breaks. CP3 will have additional tests on Tuesday morning which will include an MRI, so hopefully we get more good news. For now, the Clippers have diagnosed him with a sprained left thumb and he should be considered day-to-day barring another update. If we learn that he will miss additional time, Raymond Felton and Austin Rivers will benefit the most."
,"Rudy Gobert goes for 18-17-4 in win: Gobert hit 8-of-12 shots and also had a steal, and we were simply a year too early on predicting his breakout season. It's happening before our eyes, as he's averaging 12.3 points, 12.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game. Tyson Chandler was out and Alex Len played just 21 minutes, leaving Gobert to roam free without much opposition tonight."
,"Joe Ingles scores 11 in start for Jazz: The Jazz play two more times this week, meaning Ingles should have at least a couple more starts in him with Hood out for at least a couple weeks. If you have dead weight you want to cut to take advantage of Ingles' new opportunity, go for it."
,"P.J. Tucker hauls in season-high 13 boards: Tucker is averaging just 6.2 points over his last five games, but also 7.8 rebounds and 1.8 steals in 29 minutes a game. He doesn't hit threes, hand out assists or block shots, and with his shaky field goal percentage and lack of scoring, is a borderline player to target in fantasy leagues. Chances are you can do better off your waiver wire."
,"Chris Paul (sprained thumb) will not return: Paul banged knees with Russell Westbrook (CP3's knee is fine), but he also appeared to jam his thumb into Westy's side. The sprained thumb is likely something CP3 can play through since it's to his non-shooting hand, but we won't know for sure until after the game. The Clippers are leading by 17 points at half, so they might be playing it safe as well by holding him out. If he does need to miss time, both Raymond Felton and Austin Rivers will be worth picking up in standard leagues. CP3 finished with eight points, six assists, three rebounds, one steal and two triples."
,"Devin Booker scores 25 in loss to Jazz: The minutes were amazing, but the fact he didn't do anything but score is the thing that's holding Booker back from being a fantasy stud. He scored 39 points in each of his previous two games, but had just three rebounds and five assists in those, although he was knocking down 3-pointers before tonight's game. Over his last five, Booker is averaging 30.6 points, 2.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 0.6 steals, 0.2 blocks and 3.0 3-pointers on 54 percent shooting. The points are fun and great, but his lack of peripheral stats are a hassle. If you want to sell high on Booker, now's the time to do so based on his crazy scoring average of late."
,"Kevin Love (back) won't miss additional time: He said his back tightened up on him at Sunday's practice and it flared up when he bumped into Zaza Pachulia in the second quarter. Love did not return to the game after halftime, but the Cavs were likely being cautious due to the lopsided score. Expect Love to play on Thursday vs. the Suns."
,"Eric Bledsoe just misses big triple-double: He just missed the third triple-double of his career, but is quietly rolling this season. He's averaging 23.2 points, 4.6 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.8 3-pointers on 53 percent shooting over his last five games and hasn't missed a single game thus far. He has an ugly injury history and this season's minutes could catch up to him at some point, but for now, he looks like a must-own, must-start player until further notice. If you do trade him due to injury concerns, make sure you get plenty in return, as he appears to be on a mission to have a big season."
,"Alex Len quiet in start for Chandler (flu): The Suns rolled with a small lineup for the most of the night, so Len never got loose. He played quite well when he was on the court, hitting 3-of-4 shots, and there's still a chance the Suns bench Chandler and get an up-close look at Len the rest of the way. But for now, Len is a luxury hold with hopes that he breaks out at some point."
,"Chris Paul (knee) goes to locker room: CP3 might be fine, but his reaction (kicking the bench seats) and going straight to the locker room is a bit concerning. We'll get a halftime report on him and update his status, but as of now, CP3 should be considered questionable to return for the second half. If he's injured, a red-hot Austin Rivers gets even hotter, and Raymond Felton would see a big boost in playing time."
,"Iman Shumpert scores 15 in start: He pulled down nine rebounds and added three steals and two triples in 30 minutes. Shump scored 16 points with two steals and four 3-pointers in 26 minutes in his previous start, so he might be worth a flier in deeper leagues if he can keep this up."
,"T.J. Warren scores 15, not much else: Warren is back, but doesn't look like the same player he was prior to his head injury. There's plenty of time for him to get going again, but his averages of just 11.8 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 0.0 blocks and 0.4 3-pointers on 54 percent shooting are not awe inspiring. He may find his game again and finish up strong, but for now, he's only worth keeping around in 12-team leagues as a fill-in when you don't have a full roster. His lack of anything but the occasional nice scoring night is a concern."
,"Marquese Chriss has tough night vs. Jazz: Chriss fouled Gordon Hayward with 13.6 seconds left in the game and the Suns down one, and then had his shot blocked by Rudy Gobert to seal the win for the Jazz. Chriss' confidence probably took a hit tonight and it may be a good time to think about dumping him for a free agent. But as it stands, he's still starting for one of the worst teams in the league and appears to have a bright future."
,"Kyle Korver hits three treys in loss: He started the second half in place of Kevin Love (back), but aside from the three triples, Korver was exposed on the defensive end as the Warriors appeared to attack him on nearly every possession. In terms of fantasy, Korver appears to have found his shooting touch with a combined seven 3-pointers over his last two games. He's a great 3-point specialist, but he's not going to help you in many other categories."
,"LeBron James scores 20 on 6-of-18 shooting: He didn't have much help tonight, but LBJ didn't play up to his standards either. LeBron and Kyrie Irving combined to turn the ball over 12 times, and LeBron had a +/- rating of -32 which was the worst on the team. He added eight rebounds, two assists, one steal and a triple, but he will be in a prime spot to bounce back from this on Thursday vs. the Suns. Irving added 17 points, two assists, two rebounds, one steal and one triple."
,"Andre Iguodala scores season-high 14 points: You just knew he was going to step up with LeBron James in town. Iguodala did all of his damage in just 25 minutes of the blowout, adding five assists, three rebounds, one block and two triples. As good as he was tonight, Iggy was only averaging 5.7 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists on the season, so we can't get behind an add in standard leagues."
,"Stephen Curry hands out 11 assists in win: Curry was quiet when these two teams met on Christmas day, but he looked much more comfortable out there this time. He finished 7-of-20 from the field and 5-of-12 from beyond the arc, adding two rebounds and four steals in 31 minutes. Curry has been a new player since the turn of the year and was averaging 29.2 points, 6.2 assists and 4.2 3-pointers in his previous six January games. This is the Curry fantasy owners spent a top-3 pick on."
,"Kevin Durant scores 21 on 9-of-16 FGs: Durant had three blocks on the night including a massive rejection on a LeBron James dunk attempt (link below). He added six rebounds, five assists, two steals and three triples, but only played 29 minutes in the blowout win. Durant should be a popular DFS target on Wednesday vs. Russell Westbrook and the Thunder. The last time those two teams met, Durant had 39 points on 15-of-24 shooting."
,"Draymond Green triple-doubles in win vs. Cavs: This was his third triple-double of the season and the 17th of his career. Green was incredible on the defensive end, racking up one steal and matching his career-high with five blocks. He didn't have a single turnover in 35 minutes and finished 4-of-6 from the field and 3-of-4 from the stripe in one of his best lines of the season. The Warriors will go for their fifth straight win on Wednesday vs. the Thunder."
,"Kelly Olynyk scores 15 off Boston bench: Olynk is playing well right now and appears to be on the cusp of starting for Boston. But even if he continues to come off the bench, he's averaging 14.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.2 3-pointers while shooting 64 percent from the field in 26 minutes a game over his last five. He's a hot pickup in fantasy right now, even if he never does crack Boston's starting five."
,"Marcus Smart scores two points off bench: With Avery Bradley back from his achilles injury, Smart took a hit by returning to the bench. He still filled the stat sheet and is still a player worth owning in most 12-team leagues, although he's not going to be quite as fun to own as he was when Bradley was in street clothes."
,"Avery Bradley back in action on Monday: Bradley was playing at an incredible level when he exited three games ago and showed some rust tonight. But the minutes were encouraging and he should be put back in fantasy lineups across the board. His five points were a season-low, but he should get back on track soon, as he only missed three games with the injury."
,"Al Horford comes through with 22 points: This was Horford's most points scored since he had 23 way back on Dec. 23. His assist numbers are impressive and he's averaging 14.0 points, 7.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 0.8 steals, 1.0 blocks and 1.6 3-pointers while shooting 43 percent over his last five games. Over his last four games, his field goal percentage jumps to 53 percent, so look at him as one of the hotter shooting perimeter centers in the league right now."
,"Jerami Grant will start vs. the Clippers: Steven Adams (concussion) is out, but it was initially believed that Enes Kanter would move into the starting five after he was listed as a probable starter. Instead, the Thunder will go with a frontcourt of Grant and Domantas Sabonis to match up with the small-ball lineup of the Clippers. Grant is just a short-term option for owners in need of a couple blocks."
,"Jae Crowder fills stat sheet on Monday: Crowder has talked about taking a week off at some point later this season, but until it happens, he's playing very well right now. Over his last three games he's averaging 17.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.7 3-pointers over his last three games. Ride him until he shuts it down, or take this opportunity to sell-high on the hot forward."
,"Isaiah Thomas scores 35 in win over Hornets: That makes 25 straight games with at least 20 points for IT2 and he'd have a perfect season going in that regard if not for an 18-point game back on Nov. 18. Think about that for a minute. The No. 60 pick in the 2011 draft has at least 18 points in all 37 of his games this season. He also scored 17 points in the fourth quarter today and is leading the league with 10.1 fourth-quarter points per game this season. Beast."
,"Marvin Williams scores 21 in loss to Boston: The problem is that he didn't do anything else, literally. Williams has actually been playing well again lately, but had just eight points and two rebounds on 2-of-6 shooting on Friday. Prior to that he had scored in double figures in three straight games and has been contributing in points, rebounds, threes, and nothing else. He's averaging 15 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.2 3-pointers on 49 percent shooting over his last five games, so if that is something that will help your team, now looks like a nice time to pick him up."
,"Cody Zeller goes for 13 & 8 in loss to Boston: Five of his rebounds were offensive, which was nice, and he played 31 minutes in the start. He had a 16 & 10 double-double on Friday and played well again tonight, meaning he should be owned in most leagues now that he's healthy and starting at center again for the Hornets."
,"Nicolas Batum just misses trip-dub in loss: Batum has been back for two games since returning from a knee injury and is averaging 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 6.0 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.0 blocks in them. He hit 7-of-14 shots on Friday, but never got it going offensively tonight, missing 9-of-11 shots and costing himself a triple-double. He's a must-start in fantasy as long as he's playing for the Hornets. Teammate Kemba Walker had the same issue, hitting just 8-of-21 shots for 24 points, two assists and three 3-pointers."
,"Wes Johnson (personal) ruled out Monday: Johnson is only averaging 13.8 minutes over his last five games, so this won't have many fantasy implications. Alan Anderson could pick up a few extra minutes in his absence, but shouldn't be trusted in any format."
,"Kevin Love (back) will not return Monday: He is dealing with lower back soreness, but the lopsided score probably has a lot to do with their decision to hold him out -- the Warriors are up by 29 points at halftime. Kyle Korver started the second half in Love's place, but we should see more minutes from Channing Frye as well. Love finished with three points on 1-of-6 shooting with three rebounds and one assist."
,"Bismack Biyombo scores season-high 15 points: Biyombo had not scored more than 10 points since early December, so this was offensive outburst wasn't expected, especially after a scary fall in which it appeared his leg bent the wrong way. Nonetheless, Orlando has shifted towards a small-ball approach, which has capped Biz's fantasy upside significantly."
,"Nikola Vucevic scores 17 in 28 minutes: Vooch has scored at least 15 points in each of Orlando's last five games and is averaging 19.4 points (on 55.7 percent shooting), 8.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.2 steals over that five-game stretch. His stock is trending upwards and his appears to be poised for a solid second half of the season now that his role in the offense is secure."
,"Aaron Gordon struggles, scores just 4 points: Gordon has alternated bad games and good games over the last two weeks. Here are his scoring totals over Orlando's last six games: 18, two, 28, eight, 21, four. Hopefully, that means he'll bounce back in a big way on Wednesday when the Magic travel to New Orleans. Despite the inconsistency, his numbers are solid this season and his roster spot in standard leagues should be secure."
,"Jodie Meeks scores 11 points in 34 minutes: Meeks once again start in place of the injured Evan Fournier (foot). Meeks' ceiling isn't very high, but he is consistent when starting. He has now scored in double-figures in four straight games. With Fournier potentially out the rest of the week, Meeks should continue to start for the foreseeable future, which makes Meeks a decent short-term add in deep leagues."
,"Elfrid Payton stays hot, double-doubles: Payton has had an up-and-down season but has reeled off three straight great games. He is averaging 22.3 points, 9.3 assists and 5.6 rebounds over Orlando's last three contests. Backup D.J. Augustin played only 19 minutes, as Payton is badly outplaying Augustin of late. In addition, Evan Fournier (foot) missed another game, which opened up more minutes for Elf. Payton's stock is definitely on the rise."
,"Jared Dudley will not play Monday: Dudley has played a total of five minutes in January, so this doesn't have any fantasy implications."
,"Jameer Nelson scores 18 points in 32 minutes: Gary Harris sprained his ankle just three minutes into the game, which opened up extra playing time for Nelson, who has now scored in double-figures in three straight games. Harris is doubtful for Tuesday's game vs. the Lakers, so Nelson could be in line for an uptick in playing time."
,"Wilson Chandler scores nine off Denver bench: Kenneth Faried slid into the starting lineup on Monday, which limited Chandler impact. It was actually the first time all season Chandler played fewer than 23 minutes. Wilson had been hot coming into Monday (averaging 17.4 points and 5.8 boards in 31.1 minutes over his last five games), so Monday's game can be viewed as a blip on the radar for the time being..."
,"Update: Brandon Knight (wrist) out Monday: A previous report indicated that he will be 'available,' but the Suns will hold him out for the second straight game. Knight wasn't even updated on Saturday vs. the Spurs and showed up in the box score as a 'DNP-sprained right wrist,' so it's not clear when he will return to action. He's just a stash in the hope that he's traded before the deadline."
,"Jamal Murray plays just 5 minutes on Monday: It was an old-fashioned five trillion for Murray, as he didn't tally a single point, rebound, assist, steal or block. It is surprising that Murray only played five minutes (and zero in the second half) considering that Denver starting shooting guard Gary Harris sprained his ankle just three minutes into the game. Murray has played in all 39 games this season, but Monday was the first time he played fewer than 11 minutes. With Harris doubtful for Tuesday, it would seem Murray would be poised for an uptick in minutes, but after Monday's disappointment, he can't be trusted."
,"Alex Len will start on Monday vs. the Jazz: Tyson Chandler (illness) has been ruled out, so Len will see a healthy dose of minutes if he can stay out of foul trouble. It's not clear who will back up Len, but Alan Williams would make the most sense given the Jazz's size up front. Len looks like a nice short-term pickup and he could have solid value later in the season if the Suns deal Chandler."
,"Tyson Chandler (flu) out, Alex Len to start: There have been a lot of players out with an illness around the league and Chandler is the latest victim. Let's just hope this doesn't spread to his teammates. Chandler will get a couple days off to rest for Thursday's game vs. Cleveland. Alex Len will start and looks like a nice short-term pickup. Alan Williams could back up Len unless the Suns go small with Marquese Chriss at the five."
,"Rodney Hood (knee) expected to miss two weeks: Hood is dealing with a bone bruise and hyperextended knee, so this timetable makes sense. Joe Ingles will move into the starting lineup with Hood on the sidelines, and he's worth a speculative add in most leagues. Joe Johnson should also see an uptick in minutes, and Alec Burks' could have his rehab process slightly accelerated. Hood had been struggling mightily over the past month, ranking well outside the top-250, so he's a cut candidate in leagues without an IR-spot."
,"Faried scores 20 points in season-high 33 min: Faried replaced Wilson Chandler in the starting lineup on Monday and rewarded coach Mike Malone's decision. It's just the third time this season Faried has cracked the 20-point plateau, and the first time he's played more than 30 minutes. Darrell Arthur (knee) didn't play, which opened up some extra time for Faried. It was Faried's first start since December 12th, so it will be interesting to see if Malone decides to go back to Chandler or stick with The Manimal in Denver's next game on Tuesday vs. the Lakers"
,"E'Twaun Moore scores 15 off the bench: Moore had the hot hand off the bench for the second game in a row after scoring 16 points vs. the Bulls in his previous outing. He added three rebounds, two blocks, one steal and one 3-pointer in 28 minutes, but he's likely going to be an afterthought once Tyreke Evans' restrictions are lifted or when Jrue Holiday finds his form. He's only worth monitoring in deeper leagues for now."
,"Joe Ingles will start Monday vs. Phoenix: Hood is expected to miss the next two weeks of action, so Ingles is worth a look in most leagues if you've got someone to cut. In three starts this season, Ingles has compiled averages of 13.7 points, 4.7 boards, 4.0 assists, 1.3 steals and 3.0 triples per contest on 56.0 percent shooting."
,"Mudiay dishes out a career-high 13 assists: Mudiay came into this contest struggling. He was shooting 28.9 percent from the floor, 15 percent from downtown and 50 percent on FT's over Denver's previous five games. However, he snapped out of that slump on Monday, as he was 6-of-12 from the floor and 4-of-4 from the stripe. It was the first time he's played more than 36 minutes since Nov. 18, due in part to Gary Harris (ankle) only playing three minutes.
"
,"Jrue Holiday scores 11 w/ six assists: Holiday only played 26 minutes because E'Twaun Moore had the hot hand off the bench Monday. His minutes are down in January and he's coming off a one-point dud in his previous outing vs. the Bulls, but this has opened up a nice buy-low opportunity for savvy fantasy owners. Holiday has early-round upside and was a monster after the All-Star break last season, so hopefully he can find his form soon. Moore is not a long-term threat."
,"Terrence Jones scores 15 w/ 8 boards: To the surprise of no one, coach Alvin Gentry started Dante Cunningham, but the forward predictably flopped once again with three points in 31 minutes. Gentry's handling of Jones' minutes has been incredibly frustrating, but he may be forced to roll with Jones for extended minutes with Anthony Davis leaving the game with a back injury. Jones was worth owning before Davis went down, so make sure he's not sitting on your wire as we await further news on The Brow's status."
,"Gary Harris (ankle) doubtful Tuesday vs. LAL: 'It is the same leg that his foot injury was on but this is separate,' said head coach Mike Malone. 'It is an ankle thing and he is doubtful for [Tuesday's game against the Lakers].' With Harris on the sidelines, Jameer Nelson could enter the starting lineup and Will Barton will see some increased opportunity with the second unit. Jamal Murray could also get into the rotation, although he only managed to get on the court for five minutes on Monday despite the game being a blowout."
,"Dante Cunningham scores three points in start: We have no idea why coach Alvin Gentry insists on giving Cunningham this type of workload, but it could be his downfall. The forward added just two rebounds, one steal and a triple, while Terrence Jones had 15 points with eight rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a triple in 26 minutes off the bench. Even with Anthony Davis (back) going down, Cunnigham isn't worth adding in standard leagues."
,"Brandon Knight (wrist) available to play: Available to play doesn't always mean will play, so Knight is a dubious fantasy target in most settings tonight. Over the past month, Knight has only been averaging 18.1 minutes a game, ranking well outside the top-150, so he can only be viewed as a stash with hopes he'll get traded to a better situation."
,"Nikola Jokic pours in career-high 30 points: Jokic joins Carmelo Anthony as just the second Nugget to tally at least 30 points, 10 boards, five assists and three steals in a single game over the last 25 years. However, this performance isn't a complete surprise because, despite playing through a nagging wrist injury that may require offseason surgery, Jokic has been an absolute beast of late. He is now averaging 21.6 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists over the Nuggets last seven games."
,"Tyreke Evans scores 12 points in loss: Evans appeared to bang his surgically-repaired left knee on the floor after a layup attempt and he was seen rubbing it, but he was able to carry on and didn't appear to be limited. Evans' owners are going to freak out whenever they hear about his left knee, but it sounds like he escaped with just a bruise. He added five rebounds, four assists and two steals in 23 minutes, and he could be looking at a larger role if Anthony Davis (back) is forced to miss any time -- the last time Davis missed a game, Evans went off for a season-high 29 points with four rebounds, three assists, four steals, one block and two 3-pointers."
,"Myles Turner scores 18 w/ four blocks: Turner held his own against Anthony Davis and turned in one of the best lines of the night so far, but he did shoot just 7-of-17 from the field and 3-of-6 from the line. Turner was shooting 80.9 percent from the line prior to Monday, so cut him some slack this time around. This was Turner's third game of the season with 18+ points, 12+ rebounds and 4+ blocks, second to only Anthony Davis (6) and Hassan Whiteside (5)."
,"Paul George scores 19 points in win: PG-13 added six assists, five rebounds, two steals, two triples and three turnovers in 34 minutes, but he's really cooled off in his last three games. He's averaging 16.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 2.6 steals and 1.6 triples in that span, shooting a combined 15-of-45 from the field (33.3 percent). He has two cupcake matchups against the Kings and Lakers up next, so expect him to get it going sooner rather than later."
,"Thaddeus Young racks up six steals in win: Young was poked in the left eye tonight, but it only cost him a couple minutes and he looked fine down the stretch. This was his eighth career game with 6+ steals (his career high is eight steals) and his second in the span of a week, so this wasn't a complete fluke. He finished 8-of-9 from the field and hit his only free throw in one of the best fantasy lines of the day. He gets another favorable matchup vs. the Kings on Wednesday."
,"Jeff Teague scores 16 w/ 10 assists: Teague rolled his right ankle and hobbled to the bench, but fortunately he didn't miss any time. Teague had a right ankle sprain back in November and a left ankle sprain earlier this month, but it sounds like he escaped with a minor tweak. He finished 7-of-10 from the field and hit his only free throw, adding eight rebounds and one triple in 37 minutes. Teague should be fine for Wednesday's game vs. the Kings, but his owners should double check his status just in case his ankle swells up overnight. He's yet to miss a game this season."
,"Greg Monroe scores 14 in 21 minutes: 'Moose' only played 21 minutes in this one, as the Bucks opted to roll with John Henson for his defense against Joel Embiid. Monroe was still productive with six rebounds, two assists and one steal, but his owners can expect a stronger performance and larger workload on Wednesday vs. Houston."
,"John Henson plays 26 minutes in loss: The Bucks needed his defense against the one they call The Process, so he reached 26 minutes for the just the second time in over a month. Henson did a respectable job and grabbed five rebounds with four assists and two blocks, but we'll need to see him do this a couple times in a row before recommending an add in standard leagues. Greg Monroe still looks like the center you want to own."
,"Jabari Parker scores 23 points in loss: He continues to thrive from beyond the arc and hit a pair of triples on four attempts Monday, bumping his 3-point percentage up to 41.1 percent on the season. He added five rebounds, one assist and two steals in 35 minutes, and he's now scored 22+ points in five out of his last six games. He should feast in a great mathchup vs. Houston on Wednesday."
,"Clint Capela (knee) feeling good in workouts: Capela has been out of commission since Dec. 17, but he could return to the court for Tuesday's game against the Heat. The Rockets will make an official determination on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround, but he's close enough to a return that he should be stashed in most leagues. He'll likely be eased back into things after the lengthy layoff, but once he's fully up to speed, Montrezl Harrell will lose most of his value."
,"Giannis fouls out in loss, scores 23 points: The Greek Freak hit 10-of-19 shots from the field and 3-of-5 from the line, adding six rebounds, two assists,  three blocks and two steals. Giannis (28.34 PER) moved past Kawhi Leonard (28.13) for third place in player efficiency rating Monday, and he now only trails Anthony Davis (28.45) and Russell Westbrook (29.92). His owners will get to deploy him three more times this week against the Rockets, Magic and Heat."
,"Joel Embiid scores 22 points in 28 minutes: He should've had a sixth block on a terrific swat on Jabari Parker, but the refs didn't feel the same way and called it a goaltend (video in link below). Embiid has gone to the line 32 times in 56 minutes over his last two and is arguably the most unstoppable center in the NBA these days. In the fourth, he had a 93.8 true shooting percentage, a 37.3 usage rate, a 145.1 offensive rating and 12 points in those 7.6 minutes. If you don't know, now you know. Trust The Process."
,"Dario Saric scores 17 w/ 9 boards, 4 assists: He looked great with the ball in his hands and had several flashy passes in this one. Saric finished 6-of-11 from the field and 3-of-3 from the line as he continues to log minutes at both the three and four. He was averaging 10.2 points, 5.2 rebounds, 0.8 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.7 3-pointers in his previous six January games, so he's trending in the right direction and looks like a solid stash for the second half of the season."
,"Jameer Nelson starts the 2nd half sans Harris: Gary Harris suffered a right ankle injury just three minutes into the game and will not return, which prompted Nelson's move into the starting five. He has started in the past when Harris has hit the sidelines, so he could see a decent boost in value if Harris is forced into an extended absence, as should Jamal Murray and Will Barton. We'll let you know how Nelson does after the game."
,"Chasson Randle scores 10 in 16 minutes: T.J. McConnell (wrist) could be looking at a lengthy absence, and while Sergio Rodriguez started and logged 32 minutes, Randle impressed in limited minutes and made a case for a larger workload going forward. He finished 3-of-6 from the field with two rebounds, one assist, one steal and two triples, so he should be on your radar if you're in a deeper league. We'd be surprised if the 76ers didn't sign him to another 10-day contract and it's possible that they have just found another gem."
,"Marcus Smart will return to the bench Monday: Avery Bradley (Achilles) is back following a four-game stint on the sidelines, so Smart will head back to the bench and his value will take a hit. As a reserve this season, Smart owns averages of 9.3 points, 4.3 dimes, 1.0 steal, 1.2 triples and 1.9 turnovers per contest on 34.8 percent shooting."
,"Sergio Rodriguez scores 10 w/ six dimes: T.J. McConnell (wrist) wasn't able to play and coach Brett Brown wasn't sure how much time he would miss. Rodriguez logged 32 minutes and added six assists, seven rebounds, one steal and one triple, so he looks like a nice short-term pickup and he was productive as a starter earlier this season -- he averaged 9.7 points, 6.3 assists, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0 steal and 1.7 triples in 29 previous starts. Give him a look if you need a PG who can rack up dimes."
,"Anthony Davis (hip, thumb) doubtful to return: The good news here is that the X-rays taken on his thumb and hip both came back negative, so it appears AD has avoided a serious injury. He was barely able to walk to the locker room, so it would be quite shocking to see him return to the game today. He'll end his evening with 16 points, three rebounds and three assists. Terrence Jones is going to be the primary beneficiary if Davis is forced to miss any additional time, so he's a solid pickup in any setting."
,"Jahlil Okafor scores 10 points off bench: He was very efficient tonight and also hit a pair of free throws. Okafor wasn't initially expected to play with Joel Embiid returning from a rest day, but Nerlens Noel was ruled out with an ankle sprain so Okafor took over as the backup center. 76ers' reporter Keith Pompey hinted that the team is showcasing Okafor for a trade, so if you need a big and you have a roster spot it's not a bad idea to stash him through the trade deadline. If Noel returns on Wednesday vs. the Raptors, Okafor might fall back out of the rotation."
,"Tyler Zeller (illness) will not play Monday: Zeller is finally feeling better, but Monday will mark his eighth straight game on the sidelines due to this illness. We'll consider him questionable for Wednesday's game against the Knicks, but with the main guys in Boston's frontcourt healthy, Zeller won't have any fantasy value."
,"Avery Bradley starting, Smart to the bench: He'll be returning from a four-game stint on the sidelines, and there's no word of any sort of minutes limit, so his owners can feel free to get him active. Smart's value will take a decent sized hit with the return to the bench, and Isaiah Thomas' usage rate will take a slight hit.<br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> The Celtics guards - namely Isaiah Thomas and Marcus Smart - have been very popular DFS targets in the time that Bradley has missed, but his presence leads to them both becoming less intriguing. Instead, this may be a good night to look to the Boston front-court. Al Horford will face off with a Charlotte defense that ranks 26th against centers, and while Kelly Olynyk will play, Horford is in a nice spot from a GPP perspective at a thin center position. DeAndre Jordan is still the safer cash game play."
,"Olynyk, Bradley will play Monday vs. Hornets: Olynyk got tripped up by a ball boy during Sunday's practice and rolled his ankle, but luckily the ankle tweak won't force him to spend any time on the sidelines. Bradley is likely going to start tonight, which will send Marcus Smart back to the bench."
,"John Wall scores 24 points in a win: The wrist and pinkie injuries sure don't seem to be bothering him. Wall continues to talk about tweaking his shot due to his right pinkie, but he's taking jumpers with confidence and still blowing by people on drives. The Wizards were incredible in the first half with a 71 true shooting percentage to get them to 75 points and basically put the game out of reach in the third quarter. Wall's surgeon for the procedures on his knees probably needs a raise."
,"Gary Harris (ankle) will not return Monday: Ugh. Harris just hasn't been able to stay healthy this season, as he's had some major issues with his right leg. He's now missed time with a groin and foot injury (both to his right leg), and it's looking like this new ankle injury could again force him to the sidelines for at least a few games. Will Barton and Jamal Murray will benefit sans Harris, with Barton offering a bit more upside. The only positive here is that X-rays came back negative, but we should get a rough timetable after he undergoes an MRI."
,"Otto Porter looks fine in his return: The hip strain from over the weekend clearly didn't bother him in this easy win. Porter has been arguably the best fantasy draft pick this season and is in the mix for Most Improved Player."
,"Avery Bradley (Achilles) probable for Monday: Bradley was a full participant during Sunday's practice, and was active at shootaround, so all signs are pointing to him returning from a four-game absence tonight. With Bradley back in the lineup, Marcus Smart will return to the bench and Isaiah Thomas won't be quite as active on offense."
,"Gary Harris (groin) headed to the locker room: Harris appeared to tweak his groin on a drive to the hoop, and after being evaluated on the bench, the Nuggets trainers decided to take him back to the locker room for further evaluation. It's worth noting that he was walking with a noticeable limp, which isn't the greatest sign. Stay tuned."
,"Kelly Oubre has huge game in win: He's been effective as the sixth man with minutes as a backup to multiple players depending on the matchups. Oubre was coming in cold with only nine points combined in his previous three games, so obviously he would need to do it again to warrant any consideration in standard leagues."
,"Damian Lillard struggles in bad loss: The Blazers were basically traffic cones on the defensive end to put them on a two-game losing streak. Lillard has not been right since his return from an ankle injury, averaging just 21.8 points, 6.7 boards, 5.0 assists, 0.3 blocks, 0.0 steals and 2.5 treys on 40.0 percent from the field in those six games. That's good for just eighth-round value, so he is a buy-low player right now."
,"Moe Harkless has a rough return: He only missed one game due to his strained calf.  Harkless has cooled off a tad since Al-Farouq Aminu returned to the lineup, posting just 11th round value in his last 12 games. Some of that is due to his subpar foul shooting lately, so he's still a hold in all standard leagues."
,"Thaddeus Young (eye) available to return: Jrue Holiday inadvertently poked Young in the left eye, but after being examined in the locker room, he was deemed available to return. He should be fine."
,"Allen Crabbe moves to the bench: He will continue to come off the bench as the combo wing for the Blazers. Crabbe has value in deeper leagues and would gain even more value if anything happened to the starting perimeter players."
,"C.J. McCollum scores just 12 points: His 25-plus scoring streak finally comes to an end at eight games. McCollum was actually the No. 1 player in standard leagues over that span due to his incredible shooting on pull-ups and adding stats across the board. The reigning Most Improved Player has improved yet again."
,"Paul Millsap scores 17 in full line: He had a game-sealing block of Derrick Rose to get this win. Millsap didn't shoot the ball well in this game, making just 5-of-18 from the field and 6-of-10 from the line in 39 minutes. Dwight Howard (rest) did not play, which has been a helpful scenario for Millsap all season. The Hawks are also winning games and have gone 9-1 in their last 10, so maybe he stays put."
,"Kent Bazemore may be heating up again: He didn't shoot the ball well, making just 5-of-13 from the field. Bazemore is playing with more confidence these days and had a big 24-point effort on Sunday. Theoretically, he should have seen a bump in productivity with Kyle Korver gone and it wasn't happening until recently. Maybe now he gets it going, so go ahead and pick him up after his breakout 2015-16 season."
,"Danilo Gallinari (ankle) will start on Monday: He's been playing through the sore ankle over the past few games, and his production has been fine, so owners shouldn't hesitate to get him active for a matchup against the third-worst team in the league at defending the small forward position."
,"Wilson Chandler will come off the bench Mon: Kenneth Faried will get the start in what is likely a matchup based move, but Chandler tends to get his numbers regardless of how he enters the game, so his value won't take much of a hit with the second unit. Feel free to get him active for a favorable matchup with the Magic."
,"Mike Dunleavy doesn't score: The minutes were there and he's basically slid right into Kyle Korver's role. Dunleavy is coming off an impressive 20-point on Sunday, but he's really just worth a look in deep leagues."
,"Dennis Schroder close out, scores 28 points: This was a huge game for him. Schroder has plenty of blemishes in his time in MSG. He was a DNP-CD last year and he also didn't close out in a previous game this season. Schroder also didn't close out in the previous two games, but he did today and hit a massive 3-pointer to get the win. After a brief drop off, Schroder looks like he's back."
,"Faried starting, Chandler headed to the bench: This move is likely a matchup-based decision with Orlando going with a more traditional frontcourt, so Chandler could be back in the starting five as soon as Tuesday's game against the Lakers. In 15 starts this season, Faried owns averages of 9.8 points, 8.4 boards, 1.0 steal and 1.1 blocks per contest in 22.5 minutes, so him running with the first unit won't result in a major uptick in value."
,"Harris, Gallinari starting Monday vs. Magic: They were both listed as probable so no surprises here. Emmanuel Mudiay, Kenneth Faried and Nikola Jokic will join them in the starting five with Wilson Chandler heading to the bench. Feel free to get Harris and The Rooster active."
,"Malcolm Delaney doesn't close out on: He played five minutes next to Dennis Schroder during this game, which is slightly more than the 3.9 in his previous games since the Kyle Korver trade. Delaney did close out the previous two games, but he didn't do so this time around. He does seem to have minutes locked up in the teens and he brings a lot to the table in that time, so he's worth a look in deep leagues."
,"Tim Hardaway Jr. scores 20 points vs. NY: Revenge game? Hardaway Jr.'s team got a big win at MSG to make them 9-1 in their last 10. Even though he may not start going forward, Hardaway Jr. has been terrific since the Kyle Korver trade. While he may be traded as a restricted free agent this summer, he has to be owned in standard leagues with his recent play."
,"Carmelo Anthony scores  points in loss: After the game, coach Jeff Hornacek said the Knicks weren't used to playing Melo strictly at the four. As you might expect, Melo has seen a 5.6 usage rate bump without Kristaps Porzingis next to him. On the lighter side, Melo called Ron Baker 'Burgundy' in a halftime interview (video in link below), which has been a nickname for Baker since training camp."
,"Enes Kanter listed as probable starter Monday: This report is coming from the game notes, which are notoriously unreliable, but with Steven Adams (concussion) set to sit this one out Kanter moving into the starting five does make sense. Even if Kanter doesn't start, he's sure to see a solid uptick in minutes, and per-36-minutes this season he owns averages of 24.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.2 blocks per game. He's in for a big night sans Adams and makes for an intriguing DFS target.<br/><br/><b><a href=http://www.rotogrinders.com target=_blank>RotoGrinders.com</a> Daily Slant:</b> Kanter is going to be an across-the-board play tonight as his minutes should trend closer to 33-35 as opposed to the 25-30 we're typically accustomed to seeing from him. We may not see him perform at his typical 1.14 FP per minute mark - he'll be seeing more court time with the starters - but he's the only offensive threat the Thunder have in the front-court."
,"Brandon Jennings not happy about changes: ''Every day is something new, you never know if you're going to play,' Jennings said. Uh oh. Jennings was also in a bad mood when he and Mindaugas Kuzminskas totally whiffed on a switch to leave Malcolm Delaney wide open for a jumper. Jennings may be feeling passed over for the Knicks starting Ron Baker over him here, but he's not worth adding in most leagues anyway."
,"Dejounte Murray (ankle) out Tuesday vs. MIN: He's a negligible part of the rotation on most nights, so his absence from Tuesday's game will have zero consequence in fantasy hoops."
,"Joakim Noah scores seven points in loss: This comes on the second half of a back-to-back set, which is way more playing time than he's played previously with 21.8 minutes per game on no rest. Noah will likely see a dip in playing time at some point for a number of reasons, so he's only worth a look in 14-team leagues with his recent solid play."
,"Barton, Harris, Gallinari expected to play: All these guys are probable, so owners can go ahead and plug them into their starting lineups with confidence."
,"Tarik Black (ankle) questionable for Tuesday: Black was previously dealing with a right ankle sprain, so this is a new injury. If he's out, Thomas Robinson would likely soak up most of his minutes, but that doesn't mean all that much, as Black only averages 15 minutes a night."
,"Clarkson, Black questionable for Tuesday: It's unclear exactly when Clarkson suffered this ankle injury, but we should have a better idea on his status following Tuesday morning's shootaround. If he's out, guys like Lou Williams, D'Angelo Russell and Brandon Ingram would all have the opportunity to see an uptick in minutes. Blacks absence would translate to more minutes for Thomas Robinson."
,"Mindaugas Kuzminskas scores 14 points: He had a bad laceration on his right cheek due to Kent Bazemore's hand catching him in the face, but Kuz returned and looked great. Obviously he started this game because Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) did not play, but the Knicks are hopeful he can return for Wednesday against Boston. Kuzminskas a.k.a. Cheese is worth a look in deeper leagues until KP can make his return."
,"Derrick Rose scores 18 points vs. ATL: He had a chance to win the game on the last possession, but he couldn't get a layup to fall with Paul Millsap getting a block at the rim against him. Although, he may have been fouled and it wasn't called. The Knicks clearly won't be penalizing Rose on the court for his no-call, no-show move last week with his minutes also on par with 31.8 per game since then. He'll be a low-end guy in standard leagues, but he is trending up slightly."
,"Evan Fournier (heel) out Monday vs. Denver: He's currently without an official timetable to return, and it sounds like there's a good chance he'll spend the entire week on the sidelines. Jodie Meeks will draw the start in his place, and Elfrid Payton, Aaron Gordon, Serge Ibaka and Nikola Vucevic will join him in the starting five."
,"Ron Baker scores 12 points in start: After the game, coach Jeff Hornacek said he likes how Baker competes and liked how he had three early shots to help get him going. It's unclear if this lineup is going to stick for the Knicks, but Baker didn't close this game out. For now, he's only an add in deeper leagues."
,"Terrence Jones to return to the bench vs. IND: Dante Cunningham will get the start today, and Jones value will take a hit with the move back to the bench. As a reserve this season, Jones owns averages of 9.3 points, 5.5 boards and 1.0 block per game, so he's not a great guy to utilize in daily leagues today. He's still a solid stash, though."
,"Cunningham starting, Jones to the bench: Alvin Gentry just loves Cunningham, but there's nothing to like about his production in fantasy hoops. Jrue Holiday, Buddy Hield, Solomon Hill and Anthony Davis will join Cunningham in the starting five for today's matinee, and Jones' value will take a hit with the demotion to the second unit."
,"Courtney Lee scores seven off bench: After the game, Lee said he found out he was benched just before the game. In a halftime interview, Carmelo Anthony said Lee handled the benching like a pro and also made it seem like it was more of an experiment. Lee has also really fallen off as a shooter lately, making just 2-of-15 from deep in his last four -- he was leading the NBA in 3-point percentage last month. Lee is only a 16-team guy for now."
,"Nerlens Noel (ankle) out Monday vs. MIL: He did sprain it on Saturday and was able to return, so for now we'll be considering him questionable for Wednesday's game against Toronto. With Noel on the sidelines, Jahlil Okafor will serve as Joel Embiid's primary backup, but he'll likely be working with a 20-minute workload making him an unattractive target in most settings. Noel should remain owned in all leagues."
,"Sergio Rodriguez will start Monday vs. Bucks: With McConnell on the sidelines, Rodriguez may be able to see his minutes closer to the 30-minute mark, although head coach Brett Brown may want to get an extended look at Chasson Randle who is in the final week of his 10-day contract. Still, Rodriguez is someone to consider throwing out there as a streamer for those looking for a boost in the assist category."
,"Steven Adams (concussion) out Monday vs. LAC: Adams won't be able to return until he clears the league-mandated concussion protocol testing, and whether or not Enes Kanter moves into the starting five, he's sure to be flirting with minutes in the 30s so he could have a huge game tonight. For now, we'll be considering Adams questionable for Wednesday's game in Golden State."
,"Rodney Stuckey (hamstring) out next 4 games: Stuckey has suited up for just 17 of Indiana's 42 games this season, and there's no scenario out there where he would warrant a hold. Monte Ellis and C.J. Miles will continue to earn minutes in the 20s off the Pacers' bench, and Miles is worth a look for deep league GMs looking for some 3-point help."
,"McConnell (wrist) w/out timetable to return: The only positive here is that the MRI results came back negative, but with the way Philly tends to handle injuries, McConnell could be looking at a lengthy absence here. Sergio Rodriguez will likely move back into the starting five, and with McConnell on the sidelines, he may be able to flirt with minutes in the 30s. He's worth a speculative add in deep leagues for those looking for an assist specialist. McConnell could be a tough guy to hang onto in standard leagues without an IR-spot."
,"Jahlil Okafor will return to the bench Monday: Okafor actually had a nice line in his previous outing with Joel Embiid resting, but with Embiid back in action and Nerlens Noel serving as his primary backup, Okafor is unlikely to earn enough minutes to matter in most formats."
,"Joel Embiid starting, Okafor to the bench: Embiid was rested on the second leg of a back-to-back set on Saturday, but he'll be back in action with his usual 28-minute workload for MLK day. Nerlens Noel will be serving as Embiid's backup today, so Okafor could have a tough time finding meaningful minutes. Embiid, however, is a must-start guy every time he takes the court."
,"Mindaugas Kuzminskas probable to return: Kent Bazemore made a kick-out pass and the follow through from his hand caught Kuzminsaks near the right eye, which opened up a cut, and he's now getting patched up in the locker room. It sounds like he'll get back out there, and we'll let you know how he finishes after the game."
,"Patty Mills (calf) plans to play Tuesday: He said he's been experiencing tightness in his calf for a while, so that might explain his recent dip in production. Assuming he's good to go for Tuesday, Mills should see his normal workload of minutes in the 20s. Give him a look if you need to stream a couple 3-pointers."
,"Reed (bruised sternum) probable Tuesday: Reed only plays minutes in the teens while Hassan Whiteside is healthy, but this does have a couple fantast implications. Luke Babbitt's minutes will take a hit with Reed back in the rotation and James Johnson won't  have to spend a lot of time as the backup center. Reed is just a handcuff for Whiteside's owners in deeper leagues."
,"Allen Crabbe will return to the bench Monday: Moe Harkless (calf) is back in the starting lineup, so Crabbe's run as a starter has concluded. That being said, Crabbe has actually been better as a reserve this season, so the demotion to the second unit shouldn't have a significant impact on his value. Still, he's only worth owning as a deep league 3-point specialist."
,"Moe Harkless (calf strain) will start Monday: He just finished his pre-game warmups without any setbacks, so Harkless' fantasy owners can activate him in season-long lineups. Allen Crabbe will return to the bench, but his numbers are actually better in the second unit anyways."
,"Revenge: Tim Hardaway Jr. will start vs. NYK: Revenge game! Dwight Howard is resting, so the Hawks are going to go small with Paul Millsap at center. THJ was already trending up before this news with averages of 16.4 points, 3.0 rebounds, 0.9 steals and 3.0 triples per game in January, so give him a look if those numbers mesh well with your fantasy team."
,"Dwight Howard is resting Monday vs. NYK: Howard logged 32 minutes against the Bucks on Sunday night, so the Hawks are going to give him the day off since the Knicks don't have the most imposing frontcourt with Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) out. Paul Millsap will slide over to center and is a strong DFS play, while Tim Hardaway Jr. will move into the starting lineup."
,"Josh Richardson to miss at least two weeks: We were waiting for a timetable but this is the best we are going to get. Unless you can stash Richardson in an IR spot, standard-league owners in a bad spot should probably move on. With that said, we still like Richardson's outlook for the rest of the season. Dion Waiters will get the bulk of the SG minutes in Richardson's absence and is worth a look if you need points. The Heat will also sign PF Okaro White to a 10-day deal on Monday."
,"Ed Davis (sprained ankle) will play Monday: He was considered questionable, but he said his ankle felt fine after warmups. Davis has played 21 or less minutes in three straight games, so he shouldn't be in many fantasy lineups."
,"Courtney Lee will come off the bench: The Knicks have been shredded on defense all season, so they're going to take their best wing defender out of the lineup. Sounds about right. Lee was a low-end asset to own before this news, so feel free to drop him for a hot free agent. With that said, he should still see a healthy dose of minutes Monday."
,"Otto Porter (hip) will play on Monday: He looked fine during the morning shootaround and he previously said that he was going to play. Porter has been a top-20 stud in standard leagues and his owners will want to make sure he's active, even he's not 100 percent."
,"Mindaugas Kuzminskas will start Monday: Lance Thomas (orbital fracture) is now out indefinitely and Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) will miss his third game in a row, so there are a lot of minutes up for grabs in New York. Kuzminskas has played extended minutes in his previous two games with averages of 14.0 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0 assist, 1.0 steal and 1.5 triples, so deep-league owners can give him a look if he plays well against the Hawks."
,"Ron Baker starting, Courtney Lee to bench: Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek threatened to make lineup changes after Sunday's blowout loss to the Raptors, but now we know that he wasn't just blowing off some steam. Baker has had some nice moments this season, but he has very little upside and fantasy owners can simply monitor his progress from the waiver wire. The Knicks' defense takes another hit with this lineup switch."
,"Update: Kristaps Porzingis won't play Monday: He was supposed to warm up and was considered a game-time call after going through shootaround, but the Knicks are ruling him out well before tip-off which is a bit concerning. This will now be his third game in a row on the shelf and his sixth missed game of the season due to his lingering Achilles issue. The Knicks were contemplating starting Porzingis at the five in place of Joakim Noah if he was cleared, so it's going to be interesting to see which direction they go. Mindaugas Kuzminskas is a candidate to see a sizable workload with Lance Thomas (face) also out."
,"Lance Thomas (orbital fracture) out Monday: Thomas has cleared the concussion protocol, but he will have to get fitted for a mask to protect his orbital fracture and he's considered to be out indefinitely. Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) is a game-time call and will slide back into the starting lineup if he's cleared, but Mindaugas Kuzminskas is looking at a larger role off the bench in the short term and is worth keeping an eye on in deeper formats."
,"Kristaps Porzingis is a game-time call Monday: Porzingis said he felt good during the morning shootaround, but he will see how his Achilles responds in the pre-game warmups before making a final decision. It sounds like has a great chance to play vs. the Hawks and it's worth noting that Porzingis was previously targeting this game for his return. With Lance Thomas (orbital fracture) out, Mindaugas Kuzminskas will be asked to take on a larger role if KP can't play."
,"Hoiberg praises Cristiano Felicio: 'The other thing he gives us is a big-time defensive presence,' Hoiberg said. 'We can get out and trap ball screens with him because of his ability to move. There are not a lot of big bodies that move as well as he does.' Dwyane Wade also said that Felicio is 'really growing,' and the big man is starting to establish himself as the closing center in the fourth quarter over Robin Lopez. He's averaging 6.4 points, 5.6 rebounds and 0.9 assists in 18.9 minutes per game in January, but he's someone to monitor in deeper leagues going forward."
,"DeAndre Bembry (personal) out Monday: The rookie is not in the rotation anyways as the Hawks are rolling with Tim Hardaway Jr. and Mike Dunleavy off the bench for now. Leave Bembry on the wire."
,"Cavs won't rest their big three vs. Warriors: Some within the Cavaliers' organization 'briefly pondered sitting out the trio,' but they decided against it because they want to 'gain valuable repetition' against the Warriors. The owners of James, Irving and Love can deploy them with confidence."
,"Hoiberg still confident in Doug McDermott: 'The big thing for Doug is to trust it,' Hoiberg said. 'We have a lot of confidence in Doug. Everyone in this organization does. He needs to continue to take them when theyre there. We need him to make shots. When he and Nikola [Mirotic] are shooting the ball well, we generally play well. McDermott responded with a career-high 31 points in the win over the Grizzlies after a brutal four-game slump, but McBuckets is just a 3-point specialist in standard leagues until he proves that he can string several good performances together."
,"T.J. McConnell (wrist) ruled out for Monday: He has a right wrist sprain, but he should be considered day-to-day barring another update. McConnell has thrived as the starting PG, so stick with him unless we learn that he will miss additional time. Sergio Rodriguez will likely move back into the starting lineup, but the 76ers will probably want to get an extended look at Chasson Randle before his 10-day contract expires later this week."
,"Jeff Hornacek threatens lineup changes: 'I had to start looking at different possibilities with that group,' Hornacek said. 'This isnt the first time that it has happened. We saw the second group come in there and play hard and get after it defensively and consequently they got stuff on the offensive end. None of the Knicks' starters played more than 29 minutes in the blowout, but it's possible Hornacek was keeping them fresh for Monday's game vs. Atlanta. The Knicks are tipping off in just a few hours, so we won't have to wait long to figure out if Hornacek was simply blowing off some steam. For what it's worth, many beat reporters are speculating that Joakim Noah will move to the bench with Kristaps Porzinigs (Achilles) moving to the five, assuming he's cleared to play."
,"D'Angelo Russell recovers, scores 20 points: Russell's playing time was actually down tonight, tying his lowest mark since Dec. 27, but it was nice to see him knocking down some shots -- in his previous three games, he averaged just 7.7 points on 9-of-34 shooting (26.5 percent). He has terrific breakout potential, and his recent shooting slump presented an ideal buy-low situation."
,"Victor Oladipo scores 23 points in win: This marked the first time he has a 20-point game since Nov. 30. However, Oladipo is having a nice month, averaging 34.3 minutes, 17.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.3 steals and 2.3 treys per game in January. He's becoming more consistent as the season progresses, which is a good sign for fantasy owners."
,"Ivica Zubac quiet vs. Pistons on Sunday: The Lakers intend to get 19-year-old Zubac more minutes as the season continues. Lakers coach Luke Walton said the staff is 'making an effort to get Zubac more minutes ... He's been working hard and playing well in practices.' He's an interesting rest-of-season option, but doesn't have much appeal for owners who need immediate value."
,"Russell Westbrook triple-doubles vs. Kings: He shot the ball well today, hitting 11-of-21 field goals and 4-of-5 from beyond the arc, while recording his 20th triple-double of the season. He does have a tendency to turn the ball over a lot, but makes up for it by stuffing the stat sheet on a nightly basis. He remains the leagues leader with a 41.1 percent usage rate. The Thunder are 16-4 whenever Westbrook has triple-doubled this season."
,"Andre Drummond hits rare 3-pointer Sunday: Drummond appeared to injure the knee or lower part of his right leg, but he was no worse the wear after returning and we'll leave him off the injury report. He wasn't very efficient tonight, hitting 6-of-17 FGs and 2-of-5 FTs, but he managed to sink a 3-pointer for the second time this season and fifth time in his career."
,"Steven Adams scores six points, exits game: Adams left the game after hitting his head on the floor and never returned, as he was being evaluated for a concussion. The Thunder play against the Clippers on Monday, so if Adams did indeed suffer a concussion, he will almost certainly miss that contest. If that is the case, Enes Kanter will see a boost and becomes an enticing DFS value play."
,"Ish Smith back in Pistons' rotation Sunday: Stan Van Gundy said he wanted to give Smith a game off 'to sit and recalibrate,' though it's not clear what the veteran guard was 'recalibrating' from in the first place. Smith would only be worth considering if Kentavious Caldwell-Pope's shoulder injury proves to be a long-term issue."
,"Luol Deng plays team-high 36 minutes: Deng has had some nice stretches for the Lakers this year, but his rest-of-season outlook is shaky at best. As a 13-year veteran on a team that should increasingly emphasize player development down the stretch, Deng is a borderline cut in 12-team leagues."
,"Enes Kanter scores season-high 29 points: Kanter recorded his 12th double-double of the season tonight and his fourth in the last six games. He finished one rebound short of tying his season-high. Steven Adams (head) left tonights game after hitting his head on the floor and was being evaluated for a concussion. If he misses any time, Kanter will see a boost. He faces the Clippers on Monday, a team he is averaging 23.3 minutes, 14 points, 10.3 rebounds, and one steal against this season."
,"Reggie Bullock quiet as fill-in starter: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (shoulder) and Jon Leuer (knee) were both out tonight, and the Pistons didn't want to go big with Aron Baynes in a matchup vs. the Lakers. Bullock's playing time was robust, considering his foul trouble, and he's just a short-term option in deeper leagues while KCP is out of commission."
,"Anthony Tolliver plays 31 minutes vs. OKC: Tolliver started in his fourth consecutive game tonight and has played over 30 minutes in each of his starts.  During that stretch, he is averaging 33.3 minutes, 12.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.8 steals and 2.3 treys per game. Coach Dave Joerger likes to mix it up with his starting five, so at any moment Tolliver could head back to his bench role. However, until that happens, he is worth considering in deeper leagues for fantasy owners in need of 3-pointers and steals."
,"Doug McDermott scores career-high 31 points: McDermott caught fire in the first half and helped the Bulls escape with a 108-104 road win, benefiting from extra minutes with Nikola Mirotic (illness) unavailable tonight. The third-year SF out of Creighton has had some nice moments over the past month, but tonight's eruption (against a tough Grizzlies' defense) doesn't necessarily make him worth owning. He added six boards, one steal and one block tonight, but for standard-league purposes he's only worth owning if you need a 3-point specialist."
,"Rudy Gay double-doubles vs. Thunder: This was his second consecutive double-double and his fourth of the season. He continues to have a nice January, averaging 35.4 minutes, 19.4 points, seven rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.4 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game. There is no reason to think he will slow down any time soon."
,"Zach Randolph posts 16 & 15 in win vs Chicago: In the process, Randolph passed Chris Webber for 88th on the NBA's all-time scoring list -- after Sunday's game he has 17,188 points in his career. He was awful to start tonight's game, but the veteran's newfound bench role hasn't prevented him from posting mid-round value over the Grizzlies' past 15 games."
,"Cristiano Felicio OK after eye injury Sunday: The Bulls' backup big man was poked in the eye tonight, requiring some attention from team trainers. We're leaving him off the injury report, but deep-league owners should keep an eye out for updates."
,"Tony Allen solid in 33 minutes Sunday: The Grizzlies are now 8-13 in games they've trailed at halftime this season, which isn't shocking for a team that relies on their defense to win games. The veteran Allen isn't an obvious fantasy option, but he's worth owning with averages of 5.5 boards, 1.8 steals, and 10.1 points per game on 49.0 percent shooting."
,"Robin Lopez logs 37 minutes vs. Grizzlies: Lopez helped his team earn a tough 108-104 win in Memphis. The Bulls scored a season-low 14 points in the first quarter tonight, but they recovered with a season-high 38 points in the second quarter. The Jekyll and Hyde performance didn't continue in the second half, during which they scored 56 points, and the Bulls' win leaves them just ahead of Charlotte for the No. 8 seed."
,"DeMarcus Cousins double-doubles vs. Thunder: The big man has shown his passing abilities more often this season, averaging a career-high 4.1 assists per game. He has dished out at least five dimes in 10 of his last 11 games and has flirted with a triple-double several times during that stretch. Tonights double-double, marked his fifth consecutive one. Fantasy owners should be content with his production this season."
,"Paul Zipser starts, play 15 minutes Sunday: It was a tough matchup vs. the Grizzlies' defense, but that's hardly the only reason to avoid Zipser, a 22-year-old rookie taken by Chicago at No. 48 overall this season.  Wade is due back on Tuesday, kicking off the Bulls' three-game week, and we're unlikely to hear much from Zipser until a back-to-back set on Jan. 24-25."
,"Darren Collison scores 21 points in loss: This was his third 20-point game of the month. He is averaging 29.3 minutes, 16.1 points, 3.4 assists, and 1.7 rebounds per game in January. Ty Lawson (ankle) left tonights game after suffering an ankle injury. The Kings next game is on Wednesday, so Lawson has plenty of time to rest, but if he misses any time, Collison would see an increased role and handle the majority of the PG duties."
,"Ty Lawson exits Sunday's game vs. OKC: Lawson played 20 minutes and scored four points with four assists, one rebound and one steal before leaving the game. If he misses any time, Darren Collison and Garrett Temple will get a boost."
,"Andre Drummond exits w/ right leg injury: Drummond exited early in the third quarter and had a limp as he walked into the locker room, so we'll consider him questionable to return. Aron Baynes and Boban Marjanovic would gain the most if Drummond misses any time."
,"Steven Adams exits game vs. Kings: He is being evaluated for concussion-like symptoms and will miss the remainder of tonight's game. Enes Kanter will move into the starting lineup and see a boost in production, if Adams misses any time."
,"Carmelo Anthony dissatisfied w/ Knicks' brass: His comments came in reaction to a polemical story from one of team president Phil Jackson's confidantes, Charley Rosen, who opined that Anthony 'has outlived his usefulness in New York.' Melo seems to have inferred that Rosen's column represents the view of the Knicks' front office, but he also said that he won't waive his rare no-trade clause. With the Knicks fading from the playoff picture, Melo's evident dissatisfaction with the team's leadership will make him a fixture in the rumor-mill."
,"Quincy Acy plays 20 minutes vs. Rockets: Acy is a combined 3-of-4 from deep since joining the Nets on Jan. 10, but perimeter shooting isn't a facet of his game we expect to see with regularity. He was also averaging just 3.0 minutes in his previous two appearances for Brooklyn, with a DNP-CD to his credit, and there's no reason to consider him in fantasy."
,"Rondae Hollis-Jefferson plays well vs Houston: RHJ also committed five turnovers and he played just 17 minutes in the blowout loss, but at least he was active while on the court tonight. He's an interesting rest-of-season target, since the Nets are likely to emphasize the development of their young guys, but most owners should wait before stashing him."
,"Justin Hamilton swats career-high three shots: Brook Lopez was resting tonight and this highlights Hamilton's potential role should the Nets trade Lopez this season, even though his minutes were depressed due to the Rockets' small-ball attack, as well as the lopsided score. The Nets would likely get back draft picks and/or prospects if they dealt Lopez, rather than current rotation players, which might leave Hamilton as the default starting center. That's purely speculative at the moment, but he's worth keeping in the back of your mind -- just don't expect copious swats, as tonight's fluky total all came in the first quarter."
,"Trevor Booker scores 18 points w/ full line: The veteran forward played 26 minutes and this is a welcome return to form, since he'd averaged a mere 6.0 points in his previous three games. The steals were also a great sight, having been a staple of Booker's value all season, and Quincy Acy's recent addition to the team doesn't seem like it will be an issue."
,"Isaiah Whitehead (knee) returns, plays 15 min: Whitehead came off the bench behind Spencer Dinwiddie, who chipped in eight dimes in 24 minutes as a starter. Jeremy Lin (hamstring) has been sidelined for most of the season and his return date is still something of a mystery, but it's hard to trust either Whitehead or Dinwiddie while they're pitched in a position battle."
,"Spencer Dinwiddie starts, plays 24 minutes: The Nets announced their starting lineup well after the 6pm start time, frustrating owners who were hoping to rely on Dinwiddie or Whitehead, though neither guy did much tonight. Dinwiddie's assists were nice, and he might have played more if he weren't in foul trouble, but with Whitehead active he's a dubious option in any format."
,"Trevor Ariza scores 23 pts w/ six 3-pointers: This was Ariza's second-highest scoring game of the season, trailing only a 27-point game vs. the Mavs back on Oct. 28. He didn't turn the ball over in 33 minutes tonight, highlighting one of his strengths in 9-cat leagues, and he's thriving in James Harden's shadow as a top-40 fantasy asset."
,"Patrick Beverley posts all-around gem vs Nets: Beverley played just 27 minutes in the blowout road win, and it was great to see his shot falling -- he averaged only 5.0 points on 25.0 percent shooting in his previous four games. In spite of the recent slump, Bev has been a terrific fantasy asset with career-high averages in boards (6.1), assists (4.4) and steals (1.5), to go along with 8.9 points and 1.6 threes."
,"Corey Brewer plays 18 minutes on Sunday: Brewer scored 15 points vs. the Hornets on Tuesday, but that was easily his season-high and it was just the third time he's cracked double-digits. He's a fantasy afterthought while James Harden, Trevor Ariza, Sam Dekker and Eric Gordon are all healthy."
,"James Harden gets 12th triple-double Sunday: The Rockets scored 74 points in the first half, matching a season-high, and they finished with 137 points in a high-scoring rout in Brooklyn. Harden trails Russell Westbrook's 19 triple-doubles, but he leads the league with 35 double-doubles. Any way you slice it, he's been amazing in both reality and fantasy."
,"Eric Gordon scores game-high 24 points Sunday: Gordon added three boards, three assists and just one turnover, and his recent toe injury isn't a concern. The Rockets' perimeter-happy offense has enabled him to drained a whopping 3.7 triples per game this season, which has anchored his mid-round fantasy value."
,"Montrezl Harrell gets 16 & 7 in start Sunday: The bad news is that Clint Capela is nearing a return from his fractured fibula, and could play as soon as Tuesday's road game in Miami. Harrell has carved out a reliable spot in the rotation, but he's averaging just 16.2 minutes off the bench, as opposed to 26.6 minutes as a starter. The clock is ticking, though he's worth owning until we see how the rotation shakes out with Capela active."
,"Sam Dekker (shoulder) looks good in 17 mins: Dekker didn't miss any time with the injury, but even at full strength he's an unappealing fantasy asset in standard leagues. In Houston's previous five games, the second-year forward was averaging just 5.8 points on 38.5 percent shooting, 1.2 threes, 3.6 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 0.6 steals."
,"Jon Leuer will not play Sunday vs. Lakers: Leuer was listed as doubtful and this shouldn't come as a surprise to any owners. Aron Baynes, Tobias Harris and Marcus Morris will continue to pick up the slack until Leuer gets back on the court. Consider him questionable to return vs. the Hawks on Wednesday."
,"Malcolm Delaney hands out nine assists Sunday: The rookie did his damage in just 26 minutes, and this is a great follow-up to Friday's 17-point, six-assist, four-rebound gem. He's been a plus-minus maestro all season and his incredible efficiency in January (53.7 percent FGs, 62.5 percent from deep) puts him on the radar in nearly all formats."
,"Dennis Schroder lousy in 24 minutes vs. Bucks: This marks Schroder's second straight dud, and it's not encouraging that backup PG Malcolm Delaney has been great in both of those games. The Hawks have been streaking lately and coach Mike Budenholzer isn't afraid to ride the hot hand, but there's no cause for panic here. Schroder should get back on track in a matchup vs. Derrick Rose and the Knicks on Monday."
,"Mike Dunleavy scores season-high 20 points: Dunleavy also went 4-of-5 at the FT line, but he had a few things working in his favor tonight -- the Hawks played a lot of wing-heavy lineups against a relatively small Bucks team, and more minutes were available with Mike Muscala injuring his ankle after one minute of action. We're very skeptical of Dunleavy, who is only worth a look in deep leagues."
,"Kent Bazemore scores team-high 24 points: Four of Bazemore's makes came from downtown and this is the first time he's scored 20 points since Nov. 30, so it was a welcome if wholly unexpected outburst. His shot has been awful all season, at a career-low 36.5 percent, and we'll need to see him sustain some efficiency before fully buying in. That said, Bazemore has enough proven upside to be worth a look if you need a swingman."
,"Rashad Vaughn returns, plays seven minutes: Vaughn played one stint, spanning the end of the first quarter and the start of the second, but he didn't re-appear until there were 32 seconds left of garbage time. His ankle injury is behind him, but tonight's line proves that he's nowhere near being a fantasy asset."
,"Malcolm Brogdon gets zero boards or assists: The Bucks' rookie had at least five dimes in his previous seven games, but tonight his playmaking duties were overtaken by Giannis Antetokounmpo (six assists) and Jabari Parker (nine assists). Brogdon has been a textbook waiver-wire steal this season, and owners should just shrug this one off."
,"Jabari Parker dishes career-high nine assists: The ball has been in Parker's hands a ton in January. His 31 total assists this month are more than Giannis Antetokounmpo (25) and not that far behind ostensible point guard Malcolm Brogdon (34). Giannis' ridiculous season has overshadowed Parker, to some extent, but he's flirting with top-50 value in roto leagues and has been even better for the past month. There's no reason to think he'll cool off."
,"Giannis Antetokounmpo gets 33/87/6 w/ extras: Antetokounmpo shot 13-of-22 from the field and 7-of-7 from the line, but it wasn't enough to beat the Hawks in Atlanta tonight. The Bucks' defense was their undoing, as they allowed the Hawks to score 111 points on 52.5 percent shooting (13-of-26 from downtown), and they'll need to tighten up during Monday's matinee vs. the Sixers."
,"Nikola Mirotic could return on Tuesday: Mirotic has missed four games due to the illness, which appears to be strep throat. Prior to the issue, he averaged 25.8 minutes, 10.8 points, four rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game in the month of January.
"
,"Norman Powell scores 21 points off the bench: Powell went 7-of-13 from the field and 6-of-6 from the charity stripe, giving him a solid true shooting percentage of 67.1 on the evening as he took advantage of the Knicks' lackluster effort on defense. Powell got some extended minutes tonight with the game being a blowout, but as long as DeMarre Carroll is healthy, Powell's playing time will be too inconsistent to depend on him in standard settings."
,"Jonas Valanciunas double-doubles in 28 mins: Ever since head coach Dwane Casey challenged Valanciunas to earn his minutes by dominating his matchup, JV has been a double-double machine owning averages of 14.0 points, 12.3 rebounds, 1.0 block and just 1.2 turnovers per contest on 53.1 percent shooting, which has been good enough for top-50 value in standard 9-cat leagues. After the game, Casey said that there are 'no excuses' for Valanciunas to not 'dominate' the boards, and he's been pleased with JV's performance as of late."
,"DeMar DeRozan scores 23 points w/ five dimes: The Raptors flexed their muscles in this one, going on a 21-2 run to open up the second half of action, which allowed Kyle Lowry, Jonas Valanciunas, DeMarre Carroll and DeRozan to watch the entire fourth quarter of action from the sidelines. The Raptors have what should be some easy wins coming up with a back-to-back set against the Nets (Tuesday) and 76ers (Wednesday), so DeRozan's minutes could be on the lower spectrum to open up Week-13."
,"Kyle Lowry scores 16 points with full line: Lowry finished the game with a plus/minus rating of +35, and he ranks No. 6 overall on the year in total plus/minus with 323. He's had a strong first half of the year, churning out first-round value while hitting career-highs in points (22.4), triples (3.3), field goal percentage (47.8) and 3-point percentage (51.0), so hopefully he can avoid the injury bug to close out the year."
,"Mindaugas Kuzminskas ineffective in 23 mins: This was disappointing following Thursday's 19-point outburst, particularly with Lance Thomas (orbital fracture) leaving the game after just two minutes of action. Kuzminskas may be able to see some increased opportunity with Thomas set spend some time on the shelf and Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) uncertain for Monday, but he's been too inconsistent to warrant a pickup in most season-long settings."
,"Justin Holiday scores 17 points off the bench: Holiday also went 4-of-5 from the charity stripe, giving him a sterling true shooting percentage of 83.3 on the evening. The blowout nature of the game, partnered with Lance Thomas (orbital fracture) going down early with an injury helped Holiday get some extended minutes, and it'll be interesting to see if he can keep his momentum going into Monday's matchup with the Hawks. This is a wait-and-see situation in most leagues."
,"Nikola Jokic still dealing w/ left wrist pain: Jokic shed his wrist brace for Thursday's game and plans to play without it again on Monday, and the good news is that there's no suggestion of more DNPs. 'I cannot go to push-up position,' Jokic said. '[Doctors] said they could [perform surgery], but it wasnt 100 percent that it would feel better.' This isn't a comforting update for Jokic's owners, but he's been on fire lately and all signs point to him playing through his discomfort for the rest of the season."
,"Willy Hernangomez grabs 13 boards in 21 mins: Lance Thomas suffered an orbital fracture during the opening minutes of this game and obviously did not return, which allowed Hernangomez to move into the starting lineup for the second half of action. Thomas is likely going to miss some time, and Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) is questionable to play Monday vs. the Hawks, so Hernangomez could see an uptick in minutes on Monday night. Still, the rookie has been really inconsistent this season, so he's only a speculative pickup in deep leagues."
,"Carmelo Anthony scores 18 points in loss: Melo's low minute total can be attributed to the blowout nature of the game, but his owners can expect a bounce-back performance Monday vs. the Hawks. For what it's worth, Anthony is reportedly becoming increasingly frustrated as the losses pile up in New York, and he may consider waiving his no-trade clause if the Knicks can strike a deal with the Clippers or Cavs. A move away from New York would likely hurt Melo's value, but nothing is imminent at the moment."
,"Lance Thomas w/ facial fracture, doubtful Mon: The fractured bone is near Thomas' left cheek, and with concussion symptoms it would be shocking to see him in uniform for Monday's game. Mindaugas Kuzminskas and Justin Holiday should pick up minutes in Thomas' probable absence, and Holiday looked very good on Sunday with 17 points, three 3-pointers and three boards off the bench."
,"Derrick Rose hits 6-of-12 shots for 16 points: This is pretty much your prototypical Rose-line with double-digit scoring and not much else. Rose's assist-to-turnover ratio of 1.83 is one of the worst in the league amongst starting point guards, and his lackluster contributions in assists (4.4), steals (0.7) and triples (0.3) has him sitting on a late-round evaluation on the year. He's a much more attractive guy to own in points formats."
,"Mike Muscala (left ankle) won't play Monday: The Hawks play in Detroit on Wednesday, so there's a chance that Muscala will miss multiple games. Kris Humphries should see his role increase with Muscala on the shelf, but Atlanta also relied heavily on their swingmen after Muscala's injury on Sunday."
,"J.J. Barea scores 15 points in 17 minutes: Barea also went 4-of-5 from the charity stripe, giving him a ridiculous true shooting percentage of 104.2 on the evening to accompany his 32.4 usage rate. Barea said that while he's still not completely recovered from the left leg muscle strain, he's finally starting to feel better, so his minutes should start creeping up into the 20-range. He's worth a speculative add in deep leagues."
,"Harrison Barnes hits 6-of-16 shots for 13 pts: Barnes has impressively hit double figures in the scoring department in all 40 games this season, and he's been a steady mid-round guy all year long. He's having a career-year in Dallas, and as one of the younger guys on the roster, he's not in any danger of getting hit with random rest days down the stretch."
,"Wesley Matthews scores 19 points w/ 4 triples: Matthews has been connecting on a career-low 38.6 percent of his attempts this season, but aside from the shooting he's been solid with averages of 15.1 points, 2.2 dimes, 1.3 steals, 2.9 triples and just 1.4 turnovers per game, which has him sitting on an eighth-round evaluation in standard 9-cat leagues."
,"Dirk Nowitzki scores 17 points with 3 blocks: The blocks were a season-high, and this was his second multi-block performance of the season. Not typically known as a rim defender, Nowitzki joked after the game that 'those kids better learn,' in reference to swatting away one of Zach LaVine's layup attempts. Nowitzki has worked his way into the mid-round equation over the past few weeks, but as a likely post-break shutdown candidate, his owners should be looking to sell high."
,"Seth Curry doesn't do much in 32 minutes: Curry added one triple, three rebounds, three steals and one turnover during his time on the court, but this isn't the type of production his owners were hoping for, particularly with the heavy minutes. Curry does have some nice upside, as the Mavs could turn him loose after the All-Star break once they start resting the older guys, but he's more of a stash at the moment."
,"Deron Williams double-doubles w/ two steals: Williams has been playing very well in his past three outings, owning averages of 15.7 points, 9.7 dimes, 2.7 triples, 1.0 steal and 2.7 turnovers per game on 57.6 percent shooting, which has been good enough for mid-round value. However, the sky-high field goal percentage is unsustainable, and Williams is definitely a guy that could be rested down the stretch with the Mavs sitting on a 13-27 record, so owners may want to use this hot streak to try and sell high on the oft-injured point guard."
,"Gorgui Dieng scores season-high 21 points: Dieng was en fuego on the offensive end, as he regularly abused Dirk Nowitzki on his post ups. This was a nice bounce-back game after Friday's four-point, 1-of-10 shooting disaster, and while owners shouldn't expect this sort of offensive output on most nights, Dieng's steady stream of defensive statistics with solid shooting percentages has his him churning out steady mid-round value on the year."
,"Ed Davis (ankle) questionable Monday vs. WAS: It's unclear exactly when Davis suffered this injury, but we should have a better idea on his status following Monday morning's shootaround. If he's out, Meyers Leonard would have the opportunity for some extended minutes off the bench, but he's too inconsistent to rely upon in standard settings."
,"Moe Harkless (calf) questionable for Monday: Harkless was a limited participant during Sunday's practice, and he was spotted getting some shots up afterward, so things are trending in a positive direction here. Allen Crabbe moved into the starting lineup on Friday with Harkless unavailable, but he'll head back to the bench if Harkless is able to give it a go on Monday. Check back for another update following shootaround."
,"Karl-Anthony Towns scores 18 points in loss: Over the past few weeks, Towns has crept into the first-round equation with averages of 22.3 points, 14.1 rebounds, 3.9 dimes, 1.9 blocks and 3.1 turnovers per game on 50.0 percent shooting from the field and 91.4 percent shooting from the stripe. He should be able to finish the second half of the season as a first-round stud."
,"Brandon Rush goes scoreless in three minutes: Rush did a nice job filling in for LaVine as Minnesotas starting two-guard over the past two games, but its going to be tough for him to get enough minutes to matter on most nights while LaVine is healthy. If you swooped Rush up for his short-term appeal sans LaVine, now would be the time to send him back to the wire."
,"Justin Hamilton will start Sunday vs. Houston: Hamilton has been hit-or-miss in his three starts this season, owning averages of just 5.7 points, 4.0 boards, 1.0 steal, 1.0 block and 1.0 triple on 31.6 percent shooting over 23.3 minutes per game, so he's not much more than a punt play in daily leagues. Head coach Kenny Atkinson also said that Luis Scola and Quincy Acy will get some minutes with Lopez out, but neither of those guys can be considered viable targets in most settings."
,"Zach LaVine scores 11 points w/ three treys: LaVine looked a bit rusty out there, and he didn't connect on any of his attempts from inside the arc, but the heavy minutes would suggest that he'll be just fine for Tuesday's game in San Antonio. LaVine popped off for 25 points with four triples in his last game against the Spurs, so his owners can expect a bounce-back performance."
,"Ricky Rubio hands out 10 dimes in loss to DAL: After a slow start to the season, Rubio has been steadily climbing up the rankings and over the past month he's emerged as a third-round stud in standard 9-cat leagues with averages of 8.4 points, 9.5 assists, 2.5 steals and 2.5 turnovers per game on 39.2 percent shooting. This was also his fourth straight game handing out at least 10 assists, so he's rolling right now."
,"Report: Miami granted hardship exception: This report means that an independent doctor has ruled that Josh Richardson (foot) will miss at least another two weeks with his injury, and while White could get some run for the injury-depleted Heat, Dion Waiters, Wayne Ellington and Tyler Johnson will be the primary beneficiaries sans Richardson. Owners in most settings can use a wait-and-see approach with White."
,"Lance Thomas (head) will not return Sunday: With both Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) and Thomas on the sidelines, Mindaugas Kuzminskas is going to see some increased opportunity while Carmelo Anthony will likely be forced into heavy minutes as he and Derrick Rose take turns dominating the offense. For now, we'll consider Thomas questionable for Monday's matchup with the Hawks."
,"Isaiah Whitehead (knee) available to play: He could start, which would send Spencer Dinwiddie back to the bench, but even as a starter Whitehead isn't worth a roster spot in almost any setting. Dinwiddie is also a non-option in most leagues regardless of how he enters the game."
,"Brook Lopez (rest) won't play Sunday vs. HOU: Head coach Kenny Atkinson said that the Nets having played six games in nine nights, including a Thursday-Friday back-to-back set is the reason why he's resting Lopez today. Justin Hamilton will start tonight sans Lopez, so he's on the radar as a potential streamer or DFS punt play. Sean Kilpatrick and Bojan Bogdanvoic will likely be doing the heavy lifting on the offensive end, and Caris LeVert could see some increased opportunity with the second unit."
,"Mike Muscala (ankle) will not return Sunday: He was ruled out pretty quickly after being sent to the locker room, so we're going to consider him questionable for Monday's game against the Knicks. If he's out, Mike Scott could get into the rotation and Dwight Howard could see his minutes rise to the high-30s. Monday will be the second game of a back-to-back set, meaning Atlanta won't have a shootaround, so we likely won't get another update on Muscala until closer to Monday's tip."
,"Lance Thomas (head) questionable to return: Thomas needed to be helped off the floor, and there's a chance he may have suffered a concussion. We should have more info soon, but if he's unable to get back out there tonight, Mindaugas Kuzminskas will see a healthy heaping of minutes. Stay tuned."
,"Chris McCullough recalled from the D-League: He'll return to being a bench warmer for the Nets tonight."
,"Avery Bradley (Achilles) on track to play Mon: Bradley has spent the past four games on the sidelines, but it's looking like owners can plan on having him back in their lineups next week. With Bradley back, Marcus Smart will return to the bench, and Isaiah Thomas won't be quite as busy on the offensive end. Check back for another update following Monday morning's shootaround."
,"Danilo Gallinari (ankle) probable for Monday: Gallinari has been dealing with some ankle soreness over the past few games, but the issue hasn't actually forced him to miss any time, so he should be fine for Monday night. Owners can expect to get another update following Monday morning's shootaround."
,"Gary Harris, Gallinari probable for Monday: Harris got back to the court following a one-game stint on the sidelines on Thursday, and Gallinari has been playing through his ankle soreness, so both these guys should be in uniform on Monday night. Check back for official confirmation following Monday morning's shootaround."
,"Darrell Arthur (knee) out Monday vs. Magic: It's always something with this guy, and Monday will mark his second straight game on the sidelines. Kenneth Faried and Jusuf Nurkic will likely split his limited minutes, which doesn't mean all that much."
,"Stevens says Zeller (illness) feeling better: The illness has forced Zeller to spend the past seven straight games on the sidelines, but it sounds like there's a chance he'll be able to return to action Monday vs. the Hornets. He'll likely be eased back into things, but he's not a significant part of the rotation anyway, so his return to action will have a negligible impact in fantasy hoops."
,"Reggie Bullock will start Sunday vs. Lakers: This likely means that Aron Baynes is headed back to the bench. Bullock is a solid defender, but a pretty low usage rate guy, so he's not all that attractive of an option despite the increased opportunity as a starter."
,"Jon Leuer (knee) doubtful Sunday vs. Lakers: Leuer was able a limited participant during shootaround, and while he's hopeful that he'll be able to give it a go, we're not all that optimistic. Stan Van Gundy said that Reggie Bullock will draw the start if Leuer can't give it a go, so it'll be interesting to see if Tobias Harris sticks in the starting five. For now, we're going to consider Leuer questionable for Wednesday's game against the Hawks."
,"Kelly Olynyk (ankle) doesn't practice Sunday: At the moment, It's unclear how severe this ankle injury is, but for now we'll have to consider Olynyk questionable for Monday's game against the Hornets. If he's out, his playing time will be divvied up between Jonas Jerebko and Amir Johnson. Check back for another update following Monday morning's shootaround."
,"Willie Reed (sternum) limited at practice Sun: 'During the non-contact part, there was some soreness,' Reed said. 'All in all, Im fine. Were just going to see how it feels when you take a blow to it. Thats the biggest key.' With Reed on the sidelines, James Johnson has been forced into heavy minutes, earning some run at the five-spot in small ball lineups when Hassan Whiteside goes to the bench. Reed isn't worth a roster spot anywhere."
,"Josh Richardson (foot) listed as week-to-week: 'It is still only a sprain, he is getting better but he still is in a boot,' Spoelstra said. Miami was granted a hardship exception on Sunday which means that an independent doctor has deemed that Richardson will spend at least another two weeks on the sidelines. He hasn't quite taken off this season, so we won't blame you for making the cut if you're struggling. Dion Waiters looks like Miami's starting two-guard moving forward, and he's worth a look in points leagues."
,"Patrick Patterson (knee) won't play Sunday: He will miss his second game in a row, but the Raptors are likely being cautious based on coach Dwane Casey's comments earlier in the week. With Patterson out, the Raptors are going to roll with Lucas Nogueira at the four, but that might not be ideal if the Knicks start Lance Thomas in place of Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles). Nogueira had 10 points, nine rebounds, four blocks and two assists in his last start."
,"James Young (ankle) still not practicing: Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Young is nearing a return, but it's safe to rule him out for Monday's game vs. Charlotte. He's not in the rotation anyways."
,"Brandon Knight (wrist) didn't play: As far as we can tell, there was nothing on Knight before or after the game on Knight's status from the team or the people covering the team right now. Knight was out for the same ailment back on Jan. 3, so take that for what it's worth. Obviously Knight won't be playing much with the Suns wanting to get a look at Tyler Ulis, so he will need a trade or an injury to the starters to have value."
,"Kristaps Porzingis (Achilles) out Sunday: He will miss his second game in a row and his fifth total game of the season with his lingering Achilles issue. Porzingis simply needs rest to get right and the Knicks obviously want to be cautious, but he did say that he was hopeful to play on Monday vs. the Hawks. Lance Thomas could draw another start, but he has very little upside. Mindaugas Kuzminskas scored 19 points off the bench in his last outing and is worth a look as a punt in DFS, while Carmelo Anthony gets a sizable usage bump with Porzingis on the shelf."
,"Rodney Hood diagnosed with a bone bruise: While Hood has been ruled out for Monday's game vs. Phoenix, he's going to be day-to-day moving forward because he has no structural damage. After Monday's game vs. the Suns, the Jazz are off until Friday vs. the Mavs, so it's possible he could be back for that one. Hood is a hold in standard leagues. Look for Alec Burks to see a bump in minutes on Monday in addition to Joe Ingles."
,"Zach LaVine (hip) is active for Sunday: He will be returning from a two-game absence, but there's no word of any restrictions. LaVine made it though warmups just fine and is safe to deploy in season-long leagues. We'll let you know how he looks after the game. Brandon Rush will return to the bench."
,"Zach LaVine (hip) is a game-time call: He's going to go through warmups and will play if his hip feels good according to coach Tom Thibodeau. If LaVine is able to return from a two-game absence, Brandon Rush will shift back to the bench. LaVine was also a game-time on Friday vs. the Thunder, so don't consider him as a lock to play."
,"Jeremy Lamb (foot) ruled out for Monday: This will be his second game in a row on the shelf. The Hornets are ruling him out a full 24 hours before tip-off, an indication that he could miss additional time. Luckily for the Hornets, Nicolas Batum looked healthy in 32 minutes of action on Friday. Marco Belinelli could pick up a few extra minutes with Lamb out."
,"Mavericks sign Pierre Jackson to 10-day deal: Jackson was with the Mavs earlier this season and averaged 3.0 points and 1.8 assists in 7.0 minutes per game through four appearances, so it's good to see him getting another chance. He's expected to be active for Sunday's game vs. the Wolves, but won't have much fantasy value while the Dallas backcourt is healthy."
,"Donovan wants Sabonis to take fewer treys: 'What I don't want to see him just become is just a stretch four, a guy that's just shooting 3s,' Donovan said. 'We've got to be able to utilize his ability to handle the ball and pass, his ability to play with his back to the basket. And certainly face up and shoot the basketball when it's there.' The rookie is still starting at power forward, but he's losing minutes to Enes Kanter. The rookie has missed all eight of his 3-point attempts through seven games in January and is averaging 4.1 points and 3.7 rebounds in that span, so he doesn't belong on fantasy rosters right now."
,"Walton wants Russell to keep shooting: 'If its a good shot and if his defender is under him, I want him shooting those 3s,' Walton said. 'I want him being aggressive. Id rather him err on being the side of being too aggressive than too cautious at this point. He knows that.' Russell has been held to single-digit points in each of his last three games on a combined 9-of-34 shooting, but Walton is confident that the PG will turn things around. Russell is a nice buy-low player and will look to get back on track vs. the Pistons on Sunday."
,"Mavs recall Nicolas Brussino: He will need a couple more injuries in Dallas before cracking the rotation. Brussino has no fantasy value."
,"Sam Dekker (left shoulder strain) will play: He picked up the injury at the end of Friday's game and was held out of practice on Saturday, but he's good to go tonight and there's no word of any restrictions. Dekker is averaging 5.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.0 triple through the first seven games of January."
,"Chris McCullough assigned to D-League: He will eventually get some burn on the Nets at some point after the All-Star break, but he has no fantasy value right now."
,"Clint Capela (leg) could return on Tuesday: He has missed about one month of action, but the big man is scheduled to go through practice on Monday. It's fair to assume that Capela will have restrictions right out of the gate, but he shouldn't be sitting on your waiver wire with season averages of 11.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.6 blocks. Montrezl Harrell is now a drop candidate in most leagues, while Nene loses a lot of value as well."
,"Celtics recall Demetrius Jackson: He's fourth on the depth chart at PG in Boston and has zero fantasy value."
,"Evan Fournier doesn't have a timetable: 'I was compensating a lot, so now its more than just the heel,' Fournier said. 'Its just the bottom of the foot, period. Its frustrating, man. I could probably keep playing like this, but its not getting any better and Im playing [at] like 60 percent [of my ability].' This is the same injury that sidelined him for five games in a row earlier in the season, so don't expect him to play on Monday vs. the Nuggets or Wednesday vs. the Pelicans. His owners just need to hold onto him for now, while Jodie Meeks is worth a look if you need a short-term boost in triples and points."
,"Jared Sullinger won't set a return date: 'My main focus is just trying to get my legs back under me,' Sullinger said. 'I feel like everybody else is in tip-top shape and Im just lagging. I cant keep up with [Jakob Poeltl] off the dribble, so, I got a lot of work to do.' He added that he has 'no lungs' right now, so it's going to take him a while to get into shape. Sully is going to be limited right out of the gate, so he's more of a stash in deeper leagues for now. He will eventually be the starting power forward."
,"Brice Johnson (back) nearing a return: The No. 25 pick in the 2016 draft has yet to touch the court this season after suffering an acute herniated disc in his lower back during the preseason. It sounds like he could be cleared in the near future, but he likely won't beat Blake Griffin (knee) back to the court. The rookie is not worth stashing and may not be in the rotation."
,"Mavs expected to sign Pierre Jackson: The Mavs waived the PG after a four-game stint earlier in the season, but it's not a surprise that he's getting another chance because he's been lighting it up in the D-League. He won't have much fantasy value while the backcourt in Dallas is healthy."
,"Stephen Curry intends to re-sign with GSW: 'I cant,' Curry said when asked if he could see himself leaving the Warriors as a free agent. 'Like Ive said from Day 1 when I was first asked about free agency, this is a perfect place to play. Bay Area fans are amazing, our organizations amazing, weve put together an amazing team thats competing for championships every year.' Under the new CBA, the Warriors could potentially offer Curry a five-year extension worth about $209 million, while opposing teams would only be able to offer a four-year deal worth about $133 million."
,"Report: Carmelo won't request a trade: While Anthony has never considered requesting a trade according to this report, one of Anthony's associates said 'that was as down as I've ever seen him after a game.' Given Anthony's salary, trading him would be complicated and he also has a no-trade clause, meaning he would have to agree to a move. However, Anthony is becoming 'increasingly frustrated' with losing and it's no secret that he doesn't have the greatest relationship with Phil Jackson. Anthony did respond to Wednesday's loss with a 23-point effort in a win over the Bulls on Thursday, but the Knicks will need even more from him on Sunday vs. Toronto. For now, a trade isn't imminent."
,"Burks says he saw Rodney Hood walking: Gordon Hayward didn't sound as encouraged saying it 'sucked' for Hood to be out with an injury, and Hayward added the Jazz will 'need more' of Alec Burks contributing. Hood is going to be re-evaluated, but there's a decent chance he misses time with this injury. For now, Burks is only a speculative add in deep leagues."
,"Alec Burks will be in the rotation: He said he's been waiting for this for 'like a year' and he said he knew he was ready to play. Burks acknowledged he had a serious injury and he's still improving. He said he wanted to get to the rim more and he plans on doing that more as he gets more comfortable. With Rodney Hood (knee) possibly missing time, Burks is a speculative add in deep leagues."
,"Serge Ibaka plays 32 minutes vs. Jazz: It was his second game back since returning from a one-game absence with a shoulder injury and he appears to be just fine. This was a tough matchup, so his lack of rebounds was to be expected. His next game is against the Nuggets, a team he scored 22 points with four rebounds and four blocks against in their last meeting. He attempted seven 3-pointers tonight, so his shoulder injury has not affected his confidence as a shooter."
,"Joe Ingles scores eight points in 10 mins: He did not see much run in this contest, but Rodney Hood (knee) suffered a hyperextended knee tonight, so Ingles could be in for a larger role if Hood misses. In the five games that Hood has missed this season, Ingles is averaging 33.4 minutes, 15.4 points, 4.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.6 steals, while making 17 3-pointers during that stretch. He can be considered a DFS value play if Hood is out."
,"Dante Exum a non-factor vs. Orlando: Exum appears to have fallen behind in Utahs backcourt rotation. Alec Burks is back in the picture and played well tonight, so Exum could continue to struggle for playing time in the foreseeable future. He should not be owned in any format."
,"Derrick Favors plays 31 minutes vs. Magic: Favors played big minutes on the second game of a back-to-back, but he only played 27 minutes in yesterdays blowout win against the Pistons. This was the second time since returning from injury that he plays at least 30 minutes. The increase in minutes is a big positive, so he's trending up."
,"Rudy Gobert grabs season-high 19 rebounds: This was his 27th consecutive game with double-digit rebounds and he now has five double-doubles in the month of January. Gobert continues to have a great season, averaging career highs with 12.1 points, 12.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks per game, as well as a 65.8 field goal percentage."
,"Alec Burks scores eight points in 14 mins: Burks was recalled from the D-League on Jan. 12 and could hang around for a while, as Rodney Hood (knee) suffered a hyperextended knee in tonights game. He has only appeared in six games for the Jazz this season, but could see a larger role if Hood misses any time. He looked good tonight and can play multiple positions for Utah. That being said, for now, Burks can be left on waivers, but he is someone worth keeping an eye on."
,"Nikola Vucevic scores 15 points in 32 mins: Despite the tough matchup, Vuc was able to put together a nice performance. He continues to play significant minutes, playing 32 minutes in three consecutive games. In the month of January, he is averaging 30.1 minutes, 16.4 points, 9.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.1 steals per game. Orlandos new approach on offense has not affected Vucevic in a negative way whatsoever. 

"
,"Aaron Gordon remains hot with 21 points: After a subpar game against Portland, Gordon bounced back nicely tonight and continues to have a nice month. Prior to tonights game, he averaged 31.4 minutes, 15.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.7 assists in January. At this time, there is no reason why he should be on waivers in any format, especially now that the Magic have abandoned the two-center ball that has hurt Gordon for so much this season and with Evan Fournier (foot, heel) hurting."
,"Snyder: Rodney Hood has hyperextended knee: 'Hopefully it's not serious,' Snyder said. This is just an initial diagnosis and it's still very unclear how much time he's going to miss. Hood's knee looked like it buckled on the way up, so it's possible there was some ligament damage. This could be a tough blow for the Jazz, especially with Hood getting hot all of the sudden. Alec Burks looked great in limited action and could pick up some added run. Plus, Joe Johnson and Joe Ingles may help out. The mysterious factor for Burks makes him an interesting speculative add in deeper leagues."
,"Jodie Meeks plays 38 minutes vs. Jazz: He got the start in place of the injured Evan Fournier (foot) and scored in double-figures for the third consecutive game -- he was also used at small forward in this one. Fournier could miss at least the next two games, which would move Meeks into the starting lineup and give him a boost. He can be added in 14-team leagues as long as Fournier is sidelined."
,"Bismack Biyombo plays 15 minutes vs. Jazz: It is very clear that going big is not an option for the Magic, as it has been an inefficient strategy. Plus, this is one of the best matchup for it, so it looks even worse for Biz. This has been a rough month for Biyombo, who averaged 20.1 minutes, 4.1 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.1 assists in January heading into this game. With Orlando going smaller, Biyombo appears to be the odd man out for the Magic and is a drop candidate unless you're in dire strait for blocks."
,"Elfrid Payton scores career-high 28 points: Payton took advantage of Evan Fournier (foot) being out tonight and thrived in a terrible matchup. There is a chance that Fournier misses the remainder of Orlando's road trip, so Payton could be in for a boost in production. He has been a volatile player thus far this season, but games like this put fantasy owners at ease. He probably should be added everywhere."
,"Rodney Hood hurts right knee on Saturday: It looked terrible. Hood was on a breakaway layup and his knee buckled after he stepped on Jodie Meeks' foot on the way up. He could not put weight on his leg as he went to the locker room. We'll have another update shortly, but Alec Burks could be getting some increased run with his good game today."
,"Otto Porter says he should be OK for Monday: In case you missed it, he had a right hip strain today and did not return. Porter did have this injury before in this season and even before that, so the Wizards likely just played it safe. After all, they were up pretty big in the fourth quarter. For now, expect him to be a go against Portland."
,"John Wall scores 25 points in win vs. Philly: Before the game, he said his hand injuries were affecting his shooting 'big time' and he also was trying to figure out how to get the tape on his right pinkie to not affect him on the release either. Yeah, it didn't seem to bother him at all with a flurry of three treys in just a few minutes during the third quarter. Wall looks like he's good to go and should definitely be on the All-Star team."
,"Sheldon McClellan could be starting?: The Wizards do use him as a starter most of the time when Bradley Beal or Otto Porter (hip) miss time, so maybe that happens if Porter is out. He's only averaged 9.7 points, 1.7 boards, 1.3 assists and 0.7 treys in those starts, so there's very little reason to add. One of those starts was without John Wall, too."
,"Tomas Satoransky gets 21 minutes: He surprisingly played a bunch in this game. The Wizards could be without Otto Porter (hip), but there's no need to add Satoransky almost anywhere."
,"Unprocessed: Jahlil Okafor scores 26 points: Nerlens Noel also sprained his ankle and was in foul trouble, so Okafor saw some serious burn as the only other active center. In his halftime interview, Okafor said he put in extra work for this game because he knew this was his chance. As encouraging as this was, the 76ers were ripping off wins before with Okafor out of the lineup, so he's likely going to fall out of the rotation again. Maybe this game will make teams more willing to trade for him."
,"Nerlens Noel gets into some foul trouble: He also sprained his left ankle and did return after he was re-taped. Obviously this was a letdown with Joel Embiid (rest) not playing, but it's not likely to affect his playing time because the 76ers won five of their last six, assuming he's healthy. He should be owned in standard leagues."
,"Rob Covington doesn't cash in without Joel: He did take a shot from Markieff Morris in this game and was in some pain, but he was able to stay in the game. Covington's minutes have been fine and he should remain owned in standard leagues."
,"Chasson Randle has a rough debut: It was only garbage time for the Stanford product to come in. Techincally, Chasson Randle is at least tied for the most efficient player in NBA history with his 150.0 effective field goal percentage because that's the best possible outcome. Leave him on the wire, though."
,"No Scrub: Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot scores 12: It was easily his best game and he established that before garbage time hit. Nik Stauskas has been a disaster lately, so maybe TLC starts getting minutes in the 20s. He's a plus defender for a rookie, can run pick-and-roll and is growing as a shooter. He's obviously only worth a look in very deep leagues."
,"Nik Stauskas scores just two points: The Sauce has lost its spice. In his last five, he's made just 30.6 percent from the field in 27.6 minutes per game in that span -- this guy was leading the NBA in true shooting percentage earlier in the season. With Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot coming on, maybe Stauskas loses some minutes."
