0,"Josh Richardson struggles vs. Bulls: He only played 22 minutes as Tyler Johnson had the hot hand off the bench. Richardson's shot isn't falling right now and this was his second dud in a row, but it's just a matter of time before he heats up."
0,"Norm Powell scores 14 points vs. Nuggets: Hey, he finally had a decent game after making just 30.0 percent from the field in his previous six games. Powell has lost minutes to Delon Wright several times this season, and it also hurts that he's played 139 of his 152 minutes next to <i>both</i> Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan. It would probably help if coach Dwane Casey staggered him a bit, so Powell is a borderline player for now. If he has another good game over the weekend, he could be an add."
0,"Jeremy Lamb scores 16 points vs. Bucks: We recently learned that Nicolas Batum (elbow) expects to be cleared to practice in the next 10 days and be playing in the next 2-3 weeks, so Lambs value is eventually going to trend down. Hes still worth holding onto in the meantime and entered Wednesdays game with 8th-round value in standard 9-category leagues, but its not a bad idea to see if you can flip him for a player with a better long-term outlook."
0,"Dennis Smith Jr. scores 18 points vs. Clips: He was 4-of-5 from the line, but turnovers have really been a problem. In his last four games, he has at least four in each of those games and he only has three assists over his last two combined. Rookie point guards almost always start slow, so his fantasy owners are going to need some patience here. He's also had a litany of tough matchups, but he has some better ones coming his way over the next two weeks."
0,"Kyle Lowry scores just nine points in loss: It may be time to start worrying about Lowry. This season, he's down to 32.6 minutes per game, a 19.8 usage rate, and a 49.3 TS% in seven games. Last year, he had 37.4 minutes per game, a 24.9 usage rate, and a 62.3 TS%. If you want to look at a positive, his pace is way up, but obviously he's nowhere near the player his fantasy owners drafted with just fifth-round value this season. He's a buy-low candidate."
0,"James Harden scores 31 with 7 more TOs: This was certainly not an efficient line for Harden, but he still managed to fill the stat sheet for his owner. But the turnovers are a big issue for Harden, as he's racked up seven of them in two straight games and had an eight-turnover night on Oct. 25. He's in a dubious three-man race with DeMarcus Cousins and Russell Westbrook for the league lead, but when you draft a player like Harden or Westbrook, you just throw turnovers out the window in Game 1."
0,"Rodney Hood goes scoreless on 11 shots: Only one of his shot attempts was from beyond the arc, and he added just two rebounds, two assists, two steals and a block. Hood has never been known for his consistency or durability, but there's no injury to report and it sounds like it was just an off night. Donovan Mitchell had the hot hand with 28 points, but there's room for both players to coexist. He'll look to get back on track vs. the Raptors on Friday."
0,"Trevor Ariza bounces back on Wednesday: Since returning from his foot injury Ariza had hit just 5-of-18 shots over his last two games. Hopefully this is a sign that his foot problem is behind him and he starts scoring in double figures regularly, while racking up threes, rebounds, assists and steals."
0,"Jeff Green scores 15 points: He's probably going to be looking at more minutes with Tristan Thompson out, and really something has to change with this rotation. Green still hasn't been a great per-minute guy in standard leagues, so there's no reason to add him unless he starts heating up."
0,"Marco Belinelli (Achilles) scores 8 points: The Hawks have kept him on the injury report all week, so maybe he gets a rest day soon. Atlanta likes Belinelli because he gives them another ball-handler next to Dennis Schroder, but his minutes will trend in the wrong direction when DeAndre Bembry (wrist) comes back. He had a hot start to the season, but he's scored a combined 17 points in his last two."
0,"Jusuf Nurkic posts 19 and 11 w/ 3 blocks: His owners have been waiting patiently for the big lines and it comes in the most unlikely spot, as Rudy Gobert and the Jazz have allowed the fewest fantasy points to opposing centers this season. Nurk Alert hit 9-of-18 shots with a couple turnovers, but he only managed to hit 1-of-4 free throws. He has another great chance for a big performance on Thursday vs. the Lakers."
0,"Thabo Sefolosha scores 15 points: He picked up a few minutes with Joe Johnson (wrist) out and it helped that Rodney Hood was nowhere to be found with zero points on 11 shots. Sefolosha usually isn't this involved on offense, and even though Johnson is out for a couple weeks, Sefolosha is more of a desperation add in deep leagues if you need defensive stats."
0,"Jonathan Isaac blocks three shots: He did benefit in the playing time department because the wings had to move to point guard for nine minutes in the second half. Coach Frank Vogel has said he likes Isaac at both forward spots and he did 11 minutes in the second half, so he may be closer to 24 while the Magic are so shorthanded at guard. He's a decent add in 14-team leagues thanks to Orlando's productive offense adding so much value to so many guys. Yes, we know that sentence sounds weird."
0,"Tyson Chandler gets 33 minutes: He probably was going to be closer to 24 minutes, but Alex Len had some foul trouble all game. Chandler hasn't exactly lit it up on the stat sheet and he doesn't have the bounce he once did, but he may have value in the short term. Hey, maybe the Suns could get hot and keep him active all season, too."
0,"Jimmy Butler scores 23 in win over Pelicans: Karl-Anthony Towns may not be held to two points ever again, but credit Butler for stepping up and bringing this one home. He finished 7-of-10 from the line and missed all three of his 3-pointers, adding four rebounds, two assists and three steals in 33 minutes. Butler is only returning fifth-round value in standard 9-category leagues at the moment, so a buy-low window could be open."
0,"Blake Griffin scores 20 in win vs. Dallas: The Clippers sit atop the Western Conference standings as the only West team with two losses. Griffin has transformed into a strong perimeter with at least two 3-pointers in each of his seven games this year, which only happened twice before the break last season. Griffin's lack of defensive stats and still being subpar at the line has his value down a tad, but his fantasy owners should be pleased and expect him to be an early-round guy going forward."
0,"Pat McCaw wins the backup SG job: After the game, coach Steve Kerr said McCaw will indeed be the backup shooting guard. We have seen him even log some minutes at point guard, so he should be a second-unit staple for the foreseeable future. McCaw hasn't really done much this season, but keep an eye on him in deeper leagues as a handcuff. He's also a possible DFS punt, especially if the Warriors are heavily favored at home."
0,"Anthony Davis scores 24 points vs. Wolves: The Pelicans fell to 3-5 even though Davis and DeMarcus Cousins have been playing out of their minds. The Brow grabbed 10 rebounds with six assists, three steals and one block, and he's now played 40+ minutes in two straight games since returning from his knee scare. We'd like Davis a whole lot more if the Pelicans started to win some games, and coach Alvin Gentry's seat is going get a lot warmer if they don't turn things around soon."
0,"Jerryd Bayless looks great with second unit: He still played 31 minutes, so maybe he can hold onto some low-end value. Bayless finished 5-of-9 from the field and hit both of his free throws, but his stat lines could be pretty underwhelming on the nights when his shot isn't falling."
0,"Bojan Bogdanovic scores 17 points: Yeah, the scoring is cool, but it's shocking to see he has five steals in his last four games. That's especially strange after his 200-plus minutes without a steal in the regular season before this hot streak. He's still more of a points specialist and we're not buying his recent uptick in steals."
0,"John Collins fouls out in 14 minutes: His owners can thank Joel Embiid for the rough night. Collins' owners may be in a for a bumpy ride early on, but his long-term outlook is great on the tanking Hawks. He's a hold in fantasy leagues."
0,"Serge Ibaka scores 11 in return: He missed one game for a minor knee issue, but garbage time explains the light playing time. Ibaka has surprisingly played 27.2 minutes per game in his previous outings, so he's been a small bargain in standard leagues."
0,"Richaun Holmes (left wrist) will play Friday: Easily one of the best waiver-wire pickups last season, Holmes may have restrictions out of the gate, but the backup center job should be his with Jahlil Okafor expected to be traded or bought out soon. He's worth picking up if you need a big, especially if you also own Joel Embiid."
0,"Lowry, Norm, DeMar, Ibaka & JV starting: Coach Dwane Casey did say he could extend his rotation due to the altitude, so that'll be something to watch. Valanciunas and Ibaka may be closer to 20 minutes in this game, but they should be in most fantasy lineups."
0,"Hassan Whiteside (knee) will play Wednesday: Erik Spoelstra implied that Whiteside's minutes won't be in the 30s in his first game back following a five-game absence, so he's somewhat risky of a DFS target tonight. However, he's a must-start guy in all season-long settings with a matchup against a team he tends to dominate. Bam Adebayo will return to the bench, and he might not even crack the rotation with Whiteside back in action."
0,"James Johnson moving to the bench: The team is pretty close to full strength, so coach Erik Spolestra can keep Johnson in the second unit. He'll still get his minutes and his fantasy owners shouldn't be discouraged with this move."
0,"J.J. Redick (back) is probable Friday: He got the day off at Thursday's practice, but the 76ers were just being cautious since he played 31 minutes on Wednesday after a two-game absence. His owners can deploy him like they normally would on Friday."
0,"James Johnson (knee) expected to play Friday: His fantasy owners don't need to panic, as Johnson said he's expecting to return to action on Friday vs. the Nuggets. 'When I was out there working out, just my normal pregame workouts, when I would shoot a jumper it kind of felt funny,' Johnson said. 'I went up to shoot another one, it kind of buckled. And then that was it after that.' He said he's been dealing with tendinitis for a while and that it simply flared up on Wednesday, but Johnson and coach Erik Spoelstra both downplayed the issue."
0,"Kevin Love scores 13 points with 13 boards: He's going to be shifting back to the center spot because Tristan Thompson (calf) was hurt today. Love has three starts at center and four at forward, but his numbers are slightly worse at center in that smaller sample. There's really not much to worry about here and Love should flirt with early-round value no matter where he gets his minutes."
0,"Jonathon Simmons cools off a bit: With Elfrid Payton (hamstring) still not healthy and D.J. Augustin (hamstring) out for the second half, Simmons was on the court for each of the six no-PG lineup combos after halftime tonight. While this line isn't as good as his lines coming into tonight, he should still be considered as a hold in standard leagues."
0,"Hassan Whiteside says he was winded vs. CHI: 'A little bit,' Whiteside said after scoring 13 points with 14 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one 3-pointer in 26 minutes. 'A little bit toward the end. But I expected that to come, because I've just been running in the pool, so it's hard to duplicate an actual NBA game.' Whiteside was coming off a five-game absence, and while he said he expects some soreness in his knee going forward, his minutes should be closer to 30 on Friday vs. the Nuggets."
0,"Joel Embiid sits out practice: He just played 30 minutes on Wednesday for the second time in his NBA career, so the 76ers are keeping his practice reps down to keep him fresh. He'll be ready to roll on Friday vs. the Pacers."
0,"James Johnson says he's ready to play vs. DEN: We were blindsided on Wednesday night with Johnson suddenly being announced as out after the starting lineups were released. He only had tendinitis and it sounds like he just needed a couple days off. Johnson has yet to start next to Hassan Whiteside this season, but he'll get plenty of run no matter who he plays next to."
0,"Jordan Bell fills stat sheet in 12 minutes: It was a little surprising that he was inactive for a couple games, but he sure can rack up the stats when he's out there. Per 36 minutes this year, Bell has 19.2 points, 10.2 boards, 4.5 assists, 2.8 steals and 2.3 blocks on a 75.8 TS%. He's basically Boban 2.0, and he'd become a strong add if any frontcourt players need to miss time."
0,"Skal is out of the first half rotation: He did not check into this game until the Kings were down 78-54 with four minutes left in the third quarter, so he wasn't projected to be in the rotation. Coach Dave Joerger has been trying to walk the fine line of playing veterans get giving young guys more run, so it's been really annoying on the fantasy side of things. For now, we'd consider Labissiere as a stash, but his upside is enough to hold in most standard leagues."
0,"Marc Gasol (left ankle) is starting Wednesday: The Grizzlies are going to be without Mike Conley (Achilles), but at least their franchise center is available. Assuming his ankle holds up OK, he'll get a nice bump in value until Conley returns to the lineup. Deploy Gasol as you normally would and check back after the game for an update."
0,"Mario, Harrison, Ennis, Martin & Gasol start: Coach David Fizdale didn't want to break up his second unit, but he'll get Chalmers in there for his first start since his Achilles injury. He should be looking at close to 30 minutes tonight, so he'll be a solid DFS play or stream. Expect to see Harrison staggered at times to open up minutes on the wing, or Tyreke Evans may get some PG minutes."
0,"Goran Dragic, Whiteside will play Wednesday: Dragic sat out Tuesday's practice, but he was a full participant during shootaround and there was never much doubt about his availability for tonight's game. Erik Spoelstra hinted that he'll monitor Whiteside's minutes in his first game back, so while he's safe to activate in all season-long settings, he's not quite as desirable in daily leagues. Dion Waiters, Josh Richardson and Okaro White will join Dragic and Whiteside in the starting five."
0,"Stotts says Noah Vonleh will start vs. Lakers: He made his season debut on Wednesday with 13 minutes, but now he'll get to start for Al-Farouq Aminu. There's a very good chance he won't get a full workload and Stotts is certainly going to mix it up with a lot of different combinations at forward. Considering how the Lakers will run, Moe Harkless should get a lot of time at the four, which means more burn for guys like Evan Turner and Pat Connaughton."
0,"Markieff Morris to play 15-16 minutes Friday: The Wizards will bring him along slowly as expected, so his fantasy owners will have to be patient for a little while. Kelly Oubre has improved a ton since last season, so it will be interesting to see what the rotation will look like once Morris is up to speed."
0,"Report: Pistons interested in Eric Bledsoe: Reggie Jackson would likely be included in a potential deal, but the Suns would also need a young prospect or draft pick compensation for these talks to advance. The Nuggets and Bucks were originally considered the frontrunners to land Bledsoe, but the Suns are going to wait patiently for the right offer. For what it's worth, a move to Detroit would be great for Bledsoe's value with the Pistons eyeing a return to the postseason."
0,"Willie Cauley-Stein scores 2 in blowout loss: It's been a rough go for Cauley-Stein with a decrease in his minutes and scoring in each of his last three games. In their six-game losing streak, the Kings are 29th in offense, 28th in defense and dead last in net rating, so it's been ugly on both ends. The Kings getting blowout so frequently is part of the reasoning WCS has lost value, but it doesn't get any easier. Their upcoming schedule includes at Detroit, against OKC, at home against the 76ers, at New York, at Washington, at Atlanta, at home vs. Portland, at Portland and at home against Denver. Tough schedule aside, we'd still consider WCS as a buy-low target."
0,"Donovan Mitchell goes off for 28 points: He entered tonight's game shooting a horrendous 32.9 percent from the field, but he's starting to take better shots. He finished 9-of-21 from the field in this one and hit 6-of-7 free throws, but the big takeaway is that he closed this game over Rodney Hood and looked dynamic next to Ricky Rubio. 'I didnt think I would come along this fast,' Mitchell said. 'It was kind of surreal being out there, guarding Damian Lillard and getting plays run through me. But I just wanted to go out there and compete.'"
0,"Tyreke Evans scores season-high 32 points: He was the backup point guard in this game with 15 minutes as the only PG on the floor -- that's counting Andrew Harrison. Evans become the eighth player in franchise history to score 30 points off the bench, and this was his first 30-plus scoring game since 2014. He's surprisingly been really good and healthy, so he has to be considered as a sell-high player with mid-round value in standard leagues to this point. He should be owned, though."
0,"LaMarcus Aldridge scores 24 in full stat line: This is an unusual stat line for LMA, and it actually marks the first time in his NBA career he's posted at least two blocks, two steals and two 3-pointers. His usage rate this season is by far his highest as a Spur, but of course Kawhi Leonard (quad) being out is a big reason why. Aldridge should continue to have some big lines, but his fantasy owners may want to consider selling high."
0,"Austin Rivers scores 19 points in win: Wings continue to have a field day against the Mavs, but Rivers has come through on offense in four of his last five. In that span, he's averaged 15.2 points, 1.4 boards, 1.8 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.8 treys in 31.2 minutes per game. He has struggled at the line and he's at just 39.5 percent from the line this year, so he's still more of a late-round player in standard leagues."
0,"Willy and KOQ get garbage run for Knicks: Kyle O'Quinn also got into the act with four points and two rebounds in 12 minutes, but the only center you should care about in New York is Enes Kanter, who had 12 points and six boards on 6-of-6 shooting in just 18 minutes. Willy did get into the game in the first quarter for the first time this season, which is a step in the right direction, but he's still got a long way to go before being worth of fantasy consideration."
0,Dwyane Wade scores five points in 15 minutes: He had four fouls and played his fewest minutes all season. Wade has not been able to top 24 minutes since Oct. 21 and that's probably not going to change anytime soon. Most fantasy owners probably won't want to deal with his low playing time and likely rest at some point.
0,"Steve Clifford praises Malik Monk: 'Tonight, it was his decision-making,' Clifford said. 'When he plays attacking  going to the basket  hes a very good passer, too.' Monk carried the Hornets against the Bucks with 18 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and he's also been impressive as the backup PG with Michael Carter-Williams and Julyan Stone both injured. He's hot right now, but Monk will lose value when Nicolas Batum (elbow) comes back."
0,"Lonzo Ball fails to score in 28 minutes: Yikes. He somehow managed a 4.8 usage rate in that playing time, so he clearly wasn't looking for his shot. We've heard coach Luke Walton talk about how Ball looks to pass too much at practice, so this really isn't a huge surprise. Even with the drop in scoring, Ball has decreased his per-game average in assists in each of his last four games. His fantasy owners had to know he wasn't going to be a bucket getter, but Ball is just clinging to late-round value in standard leagues. He could be viewed as a buy-low option because rookie point guards usually start slow."
0,"Tony Snell scores 17 points in loss to CHA: He buried five 3-pointers on the night and also added three assists and two rebounds in 37 minutes. Snell has been playing big minutes for Milwaukee, but was only averaging 9.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.7 steals and 1.7 triples prior to Wednesday. With limited upside, he's better suited for deeper leagues."
0,"Draymond Green scores 16 points: He was in a brutal shooting slump to start the season, but he's out of it now with at least a 50.0 field goal percentage in five of his last six games. In that span, Green averaged 10.3 points, 8.0 boards, 6.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 1.2 blocks and 0.7 treys on 59.5 percent from the field. His turnovers have been fairly high lately, so there's still room for improvement."
0,"Suns would prefer a 3rd team to take R-Jax: The Suns already have enough money tied up in Brandon Knight, so they obviously don't want another bad contract. Jackson is healthy and playing well, but his value around the league appears to be very low. Through eight games, he's averaging 16.4 points, 6.0 assists, 4.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.3 triples on 45.4 percent shooting."
0,"Kyle Anderson scores season-high 16 points: He added a season high in dimes and free throws with six. Anderson snapped a three-game streak with single-digit scoring, but coach Gregg Popovich has run him out there for about 26 minutes per game most nights. He hasn't really been worth owning in most deep leagues and he'll lose most of his playing time once Kawhi Leonard (quad) gets back."
0,"Jeff Teague held to five points in win: The Pelicans have allowed the fifth fewest fantasy points to point guards this season and Teague was coming off a monster 23-point game with 11 assists, five rebounds and three 3-pointers in 37 minutes, so his owners should brush this off and look forward to Saturday's tasty matchup vs. Dallas."
0,"Bulls to keep same starters for Friday: This means Jerian Grant has held onto the starting PG role for now, while David Nwaba will continue to start over Paul Zipser at small forward. Grant is likely starting to feel some pressure from Kris Dunn, as he had 11 points, seven rebounds, five assists and two blocks in 29 minutes on Wednesday compared to Grant's seven points, eight assists and four rebounds in 25 minutes."
0,"J.J. Redick (back) scores 8 points in return: He only hit 3-of-11 shots, but the important thing is that he played 31 minutes. With his back issue hopefully behind him, Redick can be deployed with confidence going forward as a 3-point specialist -- he was hitting 2.2 triples per game prior to Wednesday."
-,"Siakam does some damage in garbage time: This was all about garbage time with eight points coming in the fourth during a blowout. Siakam could be moved out of the rotation because OG Anunoby has been better than expected, so he's a drop candidate in very deep leagues."
-,"Paul Zipser finishes scoreless in 15 minutes: Coach Fred Hoiberg said he wants more shooting in the second unit, so Zipser will likely keep coming off the bench. He shouldn't have been owned before this demotion, and your fantasy team probably isn't doing so hot if he was."
-,"Caleb Swanigan scores five points: He was really good, especially with some of the star players. Before tonight, Swanigan played just four minutes next to Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, but that three-man combo was out there for five minutes in this game -- it's up to a +32.6 net rating in a nine-minute sample on the year. Swanigan has probably earned more run with Al-Farouq Aminu (ankle) out, but it's really tough to trust coach Terry Stotts. If you add him in deep leagues, just know there's a very good chance you drop him after the next one."
-,"Jameer Nelson goes scoreless in 20 minutes: He had a few rebounds and assists, but he's really cooled off with a combined five points in his last three games. If you haven't already, it's safe to drop him."
-,"Quincy Acy (left groin strain) out Friday: Once Acy is healthy again, his spot in the rotation will likely be long gone. Leave him on the wire."
-,"Report: Pop hopeful Kawhi returns in 3 weeks: Within three weeks could be be tomorrow or later this month, or it could be even later because Pop is 'hopeful' for that timetable. There's almost no point to guess what this means, but Kawhi owners probably shouldn't expect him back in the next week or so."
-,"Garrett Temple returns from rest: He is probably going to get rested again at some point this season, so fantasy owners shouldn't have to deal with that problem. Leave Temple on the wire."
-,"Thon Maker plays 19 minutes off bench: Dwight Howard would've bullied him if he started, so that might explain why Jason Kidd opted to bring him off the bench in favor of John Henson. Even with Greg Monroe (calf) out for two weeks, Maker doesn't get enough burn to help fantasy owners, starting or not."
-,"Hezonja not concerned about team option: The Magic declined to pick up their fourth-year team option on Hezonja, meaning they will evaluate him for the rest of the season before he becomes an unrestricted free agent this summer. 'This is not going to change anything and Im still going to be working hard on my game and still coming with the same mentality to try and get even better, he said. Hezonja has played a combined 12 minutes over the last two games and there's been no indication that his role will grow any time soon."
-,"Mario Chalmers scores seven in start: He did not have a great finish to this game with a turnover and a missed three late. 'I have to take control, run the team like Mike [Conley] runs the team and I didn't do that tonight,' Chalmers said. Conley shouldn't be out for long, so Chalmers is only a speculative add in deeper leagues."
-,"Carter-Williams (knees) is questionable: He just returned from a stint in the G-League and should be ready to make his Hornets debut any day now. Malik Monk has fared well as the backup PG, so MCW will need to play really well to earn a rotation spot."
-,"Daniel Theis posts first double-double: The amount of players that have stepped up on Boston is something else, and it's going to be interesting to see how Marcus Morris (knee) fits in. Theis figures to lose minutes, but he has surprisingly played 17.4 minutes per game over his last five."
-,"Jae Crowder starts 3Q for Tristan Thompson: Thompson was just announced out for the game with a calf strain, so he could miss time going forward. Crowder has not been very good on his new team, so most fantasy owners can take a wait-and-see approach."
-,"Arron Afflalo gets in the rotation: He's probably going to be in the rotation and he may get point guard minutes out of desperation. Afflalo is not a pickup almost anywhere, though."
-,"Dejounte Murray moves to the bench: We're not exactly sure why Murray was moved to the second unit, but it's worth a mention coach Gregg Popovich gave him an earful in first half after some mistakes tonight. Pop has never pulled any punches on Murray and he's never bashful about benching younger players, but Murray should still be able to get minutes in the 20s most nights. He's really cooled off since a hot start, so his a possible drop candidate in shallower formats."
-,"Noah Vonleh plays 18 minutes in debut: Vonleh may be forced to step into a larger role going forward, as Al-Farouq Aminu could miss time with an ankle injury. Coach Terry Stotts isn't known for his transparency, so it's unclear who he will call upon if Aminu sits against the Lakers on Thursday. Vonleh isn't worth adding for now."
-,"Emmanuel Mudiay gets the garbage minutes: The playing time was due to garbage time and coach Mike Malone wasn't happy about the defense in the fourth quarter. Malone said the last six minutes were 'embarrassing' and he 'doesn't give a crap what the score is.' Now that Jamal Murray is back to being his Blue Arrow self, Mudiay should start trending down. He was also a really bad defender earlier in the year, so tonight won't help Mudiay either."
-,"Okaro White quiet in start vs. Bulls: James Johnson (knee) is day-to-day and is traveling with the Heat for Friday's game vs. Denver, but White wouldn't be a fantasy pickup even if Johnson missed another game."
-,"J.J. Barea scores two points: This was easily his worst game, and he did only play 1.8 minutes next to Dennis Smith Jr. Barea should have some decent value in 14-team leagues, but the demand won't be very high for him."
-,"D'Antoni hoping to have Paul back in 2 weeks: D'Antoni didn't have any new information regarding Paul, but this confirms that he's still targeting a mid-November return.  The Rockets will return home to Houston after Friday's game in Atlanta, so expect the PG to be re-evaluated this weekend."
-,"Devin Harris starting for the Mavs: Harris is making his first start since 2014, but it's hard to imagine this move sticking. The veteran did have a nice game on Monday with 15 points in 25 minutes, so maybe coach Rick Carlisle is rewarding him. He'll likely be irrelevant when Seth Curry (leg) comes back."
-,"Nene back in action after Achilles injury: He missed a few games with an Achilles injury, but unless you're a big Rockets or Nene fan, you might not have even noticed he was gone."
-,"David Nwaba grabs 11 boards in start: Coach Fred Hoiberg said he wanted more speed in the first unit, so he'll get plenty of that with Nwaba. 'I don't think he's looking for me to change anything that I've been doing so far,' Nwaba said. 'Just being aggressive going to the basket, making the right decisions on kick-outs, playing my game.' It looks like he'll be a significant part of the rotation going forward, but he's only worth monitoring in deeper formats for now because his offensive game is limited."
-,"Brandon Paul scores just one point: He had nowhere to go but down after his best game of his career on Monday. Paul has stepped up since Joffrey Lauvergne (ankle) went down, so he may play a good amount on Friday in a back-to-back set. He's a very risky punt play."
-,"Hawks using probable tag again: The Hawks continue to use the probable tag on these three guys, but they've all been in active in the last two games. Expect that to be the case again."
-,"Buddy Hield scores 17 points in ugly loss: His coach admitted he was struggling recently, so this was really the only positive for the Kings today. Hield is still nowhere near being a reliable guy in fantasy, but things should start to look up as the Kings slide in the standings."
-,"Tyler Johnson scores 19 points in win: Johnson has been all over the place this season, scoring 19, 12, 2, 23 and 6 points over his last five games. That's extremely tough to rely on, so he's not the best fantasy asset while the Heat are healthy."
-,"Patty Mills starting over Dejounte Murray: Murray was even announced in the starting lineup, so this move is a big surprise. Murray is sitting on the bench next to the coaches, so presumably he's available and will just do more work with the second unit."
-,"Devin Harris scores 12 in start: Coach Rick Carlisle is trying some new stuff because his team is struggling on defense. Harris may not stick in the starting lineup for long, but it's nice to see him back in his NBA routine. He's only an add in deeper leagues."
-,Wizards waive Carrick Felix: The 27-year-old wing didn't make a single appearance for the Wizards and will likely head overseas.
-,"Semi Ojeleye scores 11 points: He only scored 10 points in his NBA career before today. Coach Brad Stevens continues to use him mostly at the four, so he may be at risk more than anyone else to lose minutes to Marcus Morris (knee). Although, his strong play could be another reason to keep Morris on the sidelines until he's 100 percent."
-,"Domantas Sabonis scores 15 with 12 boards: Coach Nate McMillan may have a tough call on his rotation with Myles Turner (concussion) likely coming back this weekend. Sabonis was playing both big spots in the opener, but he's thrived as a center since the second game. He should get at least 15 minutes at that spot behind Turner, but he may have earned 5-10 minutes at power forward, as well. His fantasy owners can hold him, but he's probably going to trend down once Turner is back out there."
-,"Jarell Martin goes scoreless: It was a bad matchup for him against some very athletic power forwards. Martin has been better than expected because of his uptick in blocks, but he'll likely lose value once JaMychal Green (ankle) comes back in a couple weeks."
-,"Jarrett Jack hits 2-of-9 shots in loss: Frank Ntilikina played 26 minutes off the bench and hit just 1-of-7 shots, but also had two points, eight assists and five steals. The timeshare is on and Jack's going to have to be better than this if he wants to keep the starting job."
-,"Kidd-Gilchrist (illness) not on injury report: He left Wednesday's game vs. the Bucks after just seven minutes and never returned, but he must be feeling a lot better on Thursday. His minute restrictions were lifted earlier this week, so it won't be long before he's a reliable source of rebounds and defensive stats."
-,"Nerlens Noel has quiet game off bench: Coach Rick Carlisle brought him off the bench and he'll continue to play the matchups. Whatever the case, Noel is pretty much set for 20 minutes per game as long as garage time isn't a factor. Before what was probably his worst game tonight, Noel came in with averages of 7.3 points, 6.3 boards, 0.9 blocks and 0.9 steals. He's been clinging to late-round value in standard leagues and won't really have much upside unless something changes."
-,"Kawhi Leonard getting closer to practicing: To put this in context, this is hardly noteworthy based on Pop's comments. 'You want a percentage? You want a percentage for each day closer?' Basically, we're in the dark on this one, but at least he hasn't had a setback. There is some hope he'll be back in this month, but it's anyone's guess."
-,Khem Birch assigned to G-League: He has no shot at minutes in Orlando as long as Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac are healthy.
-,"Luc Mbah a Moute nearly double-doubles: That's a nice stat line for Mbah a Moute, but unless he's starting for an injured player, he's far too unreliable to trust in any fantasy format off the bench."
-,"Report: Tristan Thompson to miss a month: He had an MRI on Thursday morning and it obviously didn't go well with Thompson out until at least December. Kevin Love is going to have to play a lot more center going forward, opening minutes up for Jae Crowder and Jeff Green. It's possible Ante Zizic gets a look as well, but he's not close to being on the fantasy radar."
-,"Marcus Morris (knee) targeting Friday: 'Personally, Im looking at Friday playing against OKC,' Morris said. 'I want to come back for the tough game when we play against some guys. Its a great game. I know if I miss that game and come back [Sunday]  no disrespect to Orlando  but if I miss [OKC] people will be like: You wanted to sit out that one.' Jayson Tatum is off to a great start in Boston, so we'd be surprised if coach Brad Stevens took him out of the lineup in favor of Morris."
-,"Josh Hart scores two points in loss: The Lakers may have to pull out some new combos and Hart has earned minutes, so don't be surprised if he's used as a small forward in certain matchups. He's only worth a look in super deep leagues, of course."
-,"Okaro White will start: Coach Erik Spoelstra is up to his usual tricks with another new starting lineup. With Hassan Whiteside back, it's going to be tough to tell who plays minutes at power forward. Whiteside may be limited, but most fantasy owners should avoid guys like White and Bam Adebayo."
-,"Bam Adebayo will return to the bench vs. CHI: Adebayo's minutes will take a fairly significant hit with Hassan Whiteside (knee) back in action, although he may be able to get some minutes in the rotation if James Johnson (knee) isn't able to give it a go. Still, he's not a great target in most settings with Whiteside back in the fold."
-,"Jarrett Allen (foot strain) is questionable: The Nets are one of the most cautious teams in the NBA, so the rookie will sit if he's not at or close to 100 percent. If he misses his second straight game, Tyler Zeller will get a look as the backup center. Allen is just a luxury stash at this point."
-,"Patty Mills scores just six in start vs. Dubs: The move was likely about the matchup, but Mills didn't play in the final seven minutes because of garbage time. He made eight starts last season and played 7.2 more minutes per game compared to coming off the bench with more scoring and assists. He hasn't been worth owning to this point and the move to the starting lineup doesn't really move the fantasy needle on him unless he was already on your radar."
-,"Woj: PHI unwilling to buyout Jahlil Okafor: Okafor's NBA career hasn't exactly been spectacular, but the 76ers should be able to find a trade partner so that they don't lose him for nothing. Boston has been rumored to have interest in the past, but his value wouldn't be great there. In fact, it's tough to see him landing in a situation where he'd automatically attain must-own status in 12-team leagues."
-,"Michael Beasley plays just six minutes: He could have been benched for any number of things, but we may never know why. His season high in scoring this season is six points and he hasn't played more than 18 minutes in any of his games."
-,"Dario Saric quiet in starting lineup: J.J. Redick (back) was back in the starting lineup, but Saric kept his spot in the first unit with Ben Simmons shifting to point guard. The good news is that Jerryd Bayless looked great with the second unit, so maybe the 76ers will continue to start Saric. He hit just 1-of-9 shots and turned the ball over twice, and while the return of Richaun Holmes (wrist) will only further complicate things, Saric is at least worth keeping tabs on while he's starting."
-,"Rajon Rondo still not close to return: Gentry said Rondo has been on a stationary bike, but he added he hasn't been running yet. The Pelicans are playing well without Rondo and it's a pretty easy argument to make that they're better with Jameer Nelson instead. There's very little reason to stash Rondo in most formats."
-,"Mike Scott comes up big off bench: He stepped up with the Wizards missing Otto Porter (illness). With Markieff Morris set to return this weekend, it's possible Scott can get ahead of Jason Smith for second-unit minutes. Most fantasy owners can keep him on the wire, though."
-,"John Henson looks great in starting lineup: This starting group has fared well all season and they needed Henson's size against Dwight Howard, but it's unclear if Henson will stick with the first unit going forward -- it's impossible to know with Jason Kidd calling the shots. Henson matched his career-high with six dimes, and he's certainly on the radar as a pickup with Greg Monroe (calf) out for the next two weeks. Just be prepared for a bumpy ride given his lack of consistency in the past."
-,Deyonta Davis assigned to G-League: He's played a total of three minutes this season and won't be getting any real action as long as Marc Gasol is active.
-,"Dennis Smith Jr. in the starting lineup: His knee injury has kept him limited at times this year and overall he's been a letdown. He's a rookie, so his owners should give him a long leash for him to get his feet wet."
-,"Brandon Ingram scores 14 points: Sadly, Damian Lillard hit the game-winning shot over Ingram's extended reach. With Larry Nance Jr. (hand) out, it's worth mentioning the Lakers used him at power forward at times last year, but it feels like the team just doesn't want to mess with his path to becoming the player they want him to. Ingram is still a bit of a mess on offense and he does try to make plays that aren't there all the time, but he is trending up on the efficiency side of things. He probably won't get a boost with Nance Jr. out, but Ingram looks a lot better after a rough preseason."
-,"Bam Adebayo plays 13 minutes off bench: Hassan Whiteside (knee) only played 26 minutes in his return, but that will obviously go up (likely at the expense of Adebayo). The rookie did have some nice moments last week including a 13-point, 13-rebound double-double, but he won't have much re-draft value while Whiteside is active."
-,"Jae Crowder scores nine points, starts 3Q: With Tristan Thompson out, Crowder actually logged some minutes at center in the second half. He also started the second half and should start until Thompson is ready to go. However, Crowder wasn't very good in his previous five starts, averaging 8.2 points, 2.8 boards, 0.8 steals and 1.4 treys. Unless he was already on your short list to add, he's not a great pickup just yet."
-,"Ryan Anderson stays hot, scores 21 in win: Anderson's line has been pretty thin in two straight, but if you're looking for points, threes, the occasional block and a few rebounds, he's averaging 17.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, 0.8 blocks  and 4.2 3-pointers over his last five games."
-,"Zach Collins doesn't score in 11 minutes: He was the first power forward off the bench, but he lost his run as the game went on. Caleb Swanigan is probably ahead of him, but coach Terry Stotts will play the matchups. Collins can stay on the wire."
-,"Jakob Poeltl moves down the depth chart: With Bebe Nogueira playing very well, this is shaping up to be a mess. Nogueira looked to be ahead of Poeltl for now, but it'll probably be a fluid situation. Poeltl's defense has been fantastic and he'll probably resurface at some point. He's a drop candidate, though."
-,"Chandler Parsons scores one point: He's still on a minutes limit and he finally had a bad game as a scorer. Parsons was among the league leaders in efficiency on offense and is having a very good season on defense, but he'll be up and down in fantasy. Most fantasy owners should be able to do better."
-,"Derrick Rose scores season-high 19 points: He has been decent in the scoring department with 13.7 points per game in his previous outings. However, even with this game included, Rose has just one trey, seven assists and two steals all season. He just doesn't do enough on the stat sheet to warrant ownership in standard leagues, and missing games only makes him less appealing."
-,"Kelly Oubre scores eight points: This was a letdown for him due to some foul trouble, and really struggling on defense. Still, coach Scott Brooks said he's a starter and he said he will use Markieff Morris at the five, so Oubre could stick in the first unit. Plus, the Wizards have crushed with their first unit this season, so that also helps. Still, he's probably going to trend down."
!,"Tristan Thompson (calf) ruled out for game: He headed back to the locker room under his own power, but he did have a limp. It was pretty clear he pulled a muscle in the second quarter and he may need an MRI. With Thompson out, it'll be Jae Crowder and Jeff Green stepping up. Crowder is worth a look, but we'd like to see him play well before suggesting an add in most formats."
!,"Al-Farouq Aminu (right ankle) is out vs. LAL: He rolled his right ankle on an offensive rebound attempt on Wednesday and did not return. Aminu was in a walking boot, and getting ruled out early doesn't bode well for his status this weekend. His fantasy owners should still hold him until further notice. With him out, the Blazers did actually roll with Ed Davis at the four last night, but that was likely due to the matchup against the Jazz. Noah Vonleh is probably the favorite to start, Caleb Swanigan could get minutes, and Moe Harkless is also very likely to play more power forward to open up minutes for Evan Turner and Pat Connaughton. As per usual, it'll be a team effort from coach Terry Stotts."
!,"Joffrey Lauvergne likely out 4-6 more days: 'I guess it was a higher sprain than I thought initially,' Popovich said. With him out, it's been mostly Brandon Paul being added to the rotation with some others moving to different positions."
!,"Malcolm Delaney is doubtful for Friday: He suffered the injury on Wednesday and did not return. If he's out, Isaiah Taylor will likely be moving into a backup role and gets a low-key revenge game after his four games with the Rockets last season."
!,"Aminu (right ankle sprain) will not return: With two minutes left in the fourth quarter, Aminu went up for an offensive board and rolled his ankle under the boards. He didn't land on anyone's foot, but it looked like a decent sprain as he limped off the court under his own power right away. If he's forced to miss time going forward, Moe Harkless and Noah Vonleh would likely benefit the most. He finished with eight points, six rebounds, one block and two 3-pointers in 31 minutes."
!,"Jon Leuer (sprained ankle) doubtful Friday: He wasn't able to practice on Thursday and coach Stan Van Gundy is preparing to be without the big man. Leuer is only averaging 17.0 minutes per game, but look for either Henry Ellenson or Anthony Tolliver to pick up his minutes. Neither player is a reliable fantasy option."
!,"Mike Conley (Achilles) will not play vs. ORL: The Grizzlies will take it easy on their star point guard and sit him for the first time this season. He should be considered questionable for Saturday against the Clippers. As for tonight, Mario Chalmers should be able to clear his season-high 26 minutes while Andrew Harrison is likely to shift back to being more of a point guard. That should also open up minutes on the wings, so Tyreke Evans, Dillon Brooks and others could benefit."
!,"Kidd-Gilchrist is questionable to return: He had a hard fall in the first quarter, so that may have shaken him up. Kidd-Gilchrist was not expected to have a minutes limit today, but now he's probably not going to hit 20 minutes with this illness. Expect more minutes for Jeremy Lamb, Dwayne Bacon and Malik Monk."
!,"James Johnson (knee) will travel with Heat: Johnson was held out of Wednesday's game vs. the Bulls, but coach Erik Spoelstra said his level concern for Johnson's knee is low. It sounds like he's day-to-day, but we won't hear any additional details about his status until Thursday's practice. Okaro White started on Wednesday and didn't do much in 24 minutes, so there's no one worth picking up at the moment."
!,"Robert Covington (knee) will return Wednesday: Luke Babbitt of all people crossed him up, but this injury isn't serious enough to keep RoCo from finishing this game. We'll have an update after the game."
!,"Al-Farouq Aminu (right ankle) on crutches: He was in a walking boot on Wednesday, so being on crutches a day after is a little more concerning. Aminu was ruled out earlier today and it would appear he's set to miss multiple games. There is no timetable on a return, but his fantasy owners should hold him in almost all leagues until we get more info. Noah Vonleh is listed as the starter, but it'll be a team effort with Caleb Swanigan, Moe Harkless, Ed Davis, Evan Turner and Pat Connaughton all likely to see more minutes. There really isn't a pickup to be made unless you were really on the fence on adding these guys before this injury."
!,"Elfrid Payton (hamstring) is questionable: His return can't come any sooner, as the Magic are going to be without D.J. Augustin (hamstring) for a bit. Payton would likely be limited if he's able to go on Friday, so be on the lookout for an update following Friday's morning shootaround. If Payton can't play, Shelvin Mack will draw the start and play heavy minutes with Augustin already ruled out."
!,"Larry Nance (left hand) out for game: He hurt it on a block attempt and was seen with a trainer near the locker room, so he is getting an X-ray right now. We'll have an update on the results of the exam after the game. If he misses time, we'll see more Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle and Brook Lopez."
!,"Myles Turner (concussion) doubtful for Friday: He was hopeful for this game and he did some pre-game work earlier this week, but it sounds like he's not far enough in the protocol. If he is indeed out, Domantas Sabonis will get another start at center while Thaddeus Young should see heavy minutes next to him."
!,"MKG ruled out for game: It was Treveon Graham starting the second half for MKG. Besides Graham, we should see more Dwayne Bacon and Jeremy Lamb. Hopefully, Kidd-Gilchrist will be well enough to play on Friday."
!,"Tristan Thompson limps to the locker room: J.R. Smith helped him to the bench and the training staff was looking at his left leg. Thompson didn't appear have an awkward landing, so he may have pulled his calf muscle. He was able to limp to the locker room under his own power, but he may not start the second half. Jae Crowder would likely benefit most as Kevin Love shift to being more of a center."
!,"D.J. Augustin (hamstring) ruled out Friday: He's likely going to miss action beyond Friday, so he's safe to drop in most leagues. The Magic might be getting Elfrid Payton (hamstring) back on Friday as he's listed as questionable, but Shelvin Mack would be the starter and play heavy minutes if Payton can't go."
!,"Cavs say Tristan Thompson will miss 3-4 weeks: Shams Charania of The Vertical reported that Thompson will be out for a month, so this latest update from the Cavs is slightly more optimistic. As previously noted, the Cavs will need Kevin Love to play most of his minutes at center going forward and Jeff Green and Jae Crowder will both see a bump in minutes."
!,"James Johnson (knee) not expected to play: Well, alrighty then. He is technically available for this game, but it sounds like the Heat will hold him out due to tendinitis. Johnson has come off the bench for most of his time with the Heat, so nobody saw this one coming. With him out, Okaro White, Justise Winslow and Kelly Olynyk should benefit."
!,"Aminu (right ankle) likely to miss time: X-rays taken on Al-Farouq Aminu's ankle came back negative on Wednesday night, but he left the arena in a walking boot and had a noticeable limp. 'We're going to need him,' CJ McCollum said. 'Somebody is going to have to step up until he's ready to get back out there.' Moe Harkless, Noah Vonleh, Caleb Swanigan and Zach Collins have all logged minutes at the four this season for the Blazers, but head coach Terry Stotts probably isn't going to reveal his replacement until right before tip-off. 
"
!,"Tristan Thompson (calf) to have an MRI: He was diagnosed with a left calf strain and didn't return to Wednesday's game, and it's worth noting that he left the arena on crutches. It's too early to speculate on a timetable, so we'll have to wait until after Thursday's MRI. If he misses time, the Cavs will have to play more small ball with Kevin Love at center. Jeff Green would also get a bump."
!,"Andrew Bogut (back) ruled out vs. Blazers: We've seen Bogut deal with back injuries a lot in his career, but this is different than his groin issue from later in the preseason. With him out, Brook Lopez should have a better chance at minutes closer to 30 and Julius Randle will likely play more center."
!,"D.J. Augustin strains hamstring, won't return: This is a tough blow for the Magic, especially with Elfrid Payton currently on the shelf with a hamstring injury as well. Payton is said to be nearing a return, but Shelvin Mack would be a lock to see heavy minutes on Friday vs. the Bulls if both Augustin and Payton can't go. Augustin finished with five points, three assists and one steal in 14 minutes."
!,"Markieff Morris serves one-game suspension: He's been out with a hernia, but is finally ready to make his debut. He'll hurt the fantasy value of guys like Kelly Oubre, Jason Smith and Mike Scott, and should be picked up if you have someone to cut."
!,"Malcolm Delaney (ankle) will not return: He was playing well before the injury with eight points on 3-of-3 shooting, but he's just not relevant in fantasy leagues as long as Dennis Schroder is healthy. Isaiah Taylor will take over the backup PG duties for the time being."
!,"X-rays on Aminu's ankle come back negative: He also had X-rays on his left wrist, but they were also negative. Consider him day-to-day and questionable for Thursday's game vs. the Lakers. With that said, it would make sense for the Blazers to sit him on the second night of a back-to-back set in a game that they should win."
!,"Stephen Curry scores 21 points in win vs. SA: Pau Gasol fell on his leg in the first half and Curry did have to go to the locker room to get his left knee re-taped. The team announced he had a 'left knee tweak' and was able to return just minutes later, and Curry himself said he felt OK after the game. He should be fine for a game in Denver on Saturday and the Warriors won't have a back-to-back set until Nov. 18."
!,"Larry Nance Jr. suffers broken left thumb: Not good and he's very likely to miss several weeks with this injury. Nance Jr. has really carved out a nice role in the first unit and coach Luke Walton will have to figure out how to replace his 24 minutes per game. He can start with Kyle Kuzma, who is going off on Thursday and is now set for consistent minutes on a larger scale. There should also be more minutes for Julius Randle and Brook Lopez, so expect them to trend up in the coming weeks."
+,"T.J. Warren posts career-high 40 points in W: Break up the Suns? After arguably the worst start to an NBA season, they're on a roll with a 4-1 record since coach Jay Triano took over. They're not going small anymore, so Warren is going to have to share the SF minutes with Josh Jackson. However, Jackson hasn't really fared well and is forcing a lot of stuff. Warren went off in the fourth quarter to help the Suns earn a win on Tuesday and he scored 17 in the third today. He's as hot as anyone and he could have a career year in a very fantasy-friendly system."
+,"Lillard scores 33 w/ 10 boards and 8 dimes: It's safe to say that Lillard is officially on fire as he was coming off a 36-point game on Monday. He shot 12-of-27 from the field and 5-of-5 from the line to go with four 3-pointers, two steals and five turnovers. With a matchup vs. the Lakers coming up on Thursday, his owners should be in great shape this week."
+,"Clint Capela double-doubles for Rockets: We were excited about Capela's potential this season, but it's hard to imagine anyone but his mother thinking this was coming. He's double-doubled in three straight games and in six of his nine this season, has blocked a shot in all but one game, and has a steal in seven of his nine games. Unfortunately, he won't see the Knicks every night, but then again, he's been torching everyone he's faced thus far."
+,"Brook Lopez scores 27 points in loss to POR: His playing time was dropping in a big way with only 19.5 minutes per game in his last two. With Larry Nance Jr. (hand) out, now Lopez should be looking at more minutes because Julius Randle is probably going to have to play some power forward minutes. Before tonight, that Randle-Lopez combo was only used for seven minutes all season, so that's part of the reason why we've seen Randle take so much run from Bro-Lo. After a rough start, Lopez's fantasy owners should seem him bounce back as a possible top-50 guy until Nance is back."
+,"LeBron James scores 33 in loss to Pacers: He becomes just the sixth player in NBA history to have 400 30-point games in his career (Jordan, Wilt, Malone, Kobe, Kareem). Milestone aside, things are not going well in The Land with their 3-5 record. Their halfcourt defense is a disaster and they've moved to 29th in defensive rating on the season after this game -- the Wolves could move past them in a later game. The Cavs losing games could be a good thing for LeBron's fantasy value because they're probably not clinching anything in April, and they're less likely to get garbage time these days."
+,"Julius Randle posts eight points in 19 mins: With Larry Nance Jr. (hand) going down tonight, it'll be really interesting to see how coach Luke Walton uses Randle. He's played heavy minutes next to Kyle Kuzma this year as the PF/C combo, so that is probably going to change a little bit now. Randle only played seven minutes next to Brook Lopez, so that will likely be a bit of an adjustment. Whatever the case, Randle is going to get more playing time now and should be owned in all standard leagues."
+,"Thaddeus Young score 26 points vs. Cavs: It looked like the original plan this season was to play Domantas Sabonis at center and power forward for a good amount with his total minutes at around 20-24, but he's played well enough that he may have to slide over to the four more often. Still, Young has has played 32 minutes per game and he's been effective, so the move may not affect him much. He's still a hold in standard leagues."
+,"Ben Simmons flirts with triple-double: He's healthy, he's playing big minutes and the 76ers look like a potential playoff team in the East, so Simmons' owners are loving life. As for the rookie himself, he still thinks he has a lot more to offer. 'I thought Id be playing better, honestly,' he said. 'I need to pick it up. Its awesome [being in the NBA]. I wouldnt want to do anything else. I love what I do. Im just grateful to be here, just got to keep working.'"
+,"Lauri Markkanen scores career-high 25 points: Coach Fred Hoiberg said a couple days ago that he would find more touches for the rookie and he delivered on that promise. 'We do need to add more actions for him,' Hoiberg said. 'He was thrust into a role that wasn't going to happen initially with the [Nikola Mirotic-Bobby Portis] incident that happened right before the opener. Now it's about adding after seeing what he can do on the floor.' Even when Portis and Mirotic come back, there's no way that Hoiberg can justify taking the rookie out of the starting lineup. He should be owned everywhere."
+,"McMillan plans to play Sabonis with Turner?: After the game on Wednesday, McMillan said he came into camp with the idea of Sabonis as the backup five, but he did play him next to Turner in the opener. The Pacers have used a handful of players at power forward behind Thaddeus Young, so Sabonis' power forward minutes may come from guys like T.J. Leaf or Damien Wilkins. If Sabonis can get 10 minutes at the four to go with 15 minutes behind Turner, he could have value in fantasy, especially with how McMillan said he wants to run plays through Sabonis going forward."
+,"Jonas Valanciunas returns in a loss: He was 4-of-4 from the field and he would've played more had it been close. Valanciunas will start trending up in no time, so get him back in all of your lineups."
+,"Otto Porter (illness) back at practice: He wasn't able to play through the illness on Wednesday, but it sounds like he's probable to face the Cavaliers on Friday. Similar to last season, Porter has been a fantasy stud, averaging 18.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 2.7 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.5 triples on 55.7 percent shooting. Jason Smith will return to the bench if Porter is a go."
+,"Blue Arrow's Back: Jamal Murray scores 24: He did miss his first free throw of the season and is now 19-of-20 on the year. This game had plenty of garbage time, so Murray didn't play for the final 14 minutes after his +35 in plus/minus. Murray is absolutely lighting it up over his last three with his 74.4 TS% and 26.8 usage rate, posting regular averages of 23.3 points, 2.3 boards, 3.0 assists, 0.7 steals and 2.3 treys. It's not party time for Blue Arrow's fantasy owners yet, but anyone who dropped him has to be kicking themselves."
+,"Mike Malone: Jamal Murray is PG of the future: 'Hes a different Jamal Murray than we saw earlier in the season,' Malone said after Wednesday's 24-point gem. The coach added that Murray's shooting slump from earlier this season was 'the least of my worries,' and he wanted Murray to play 'downhill' to help the flow of the offense. Now that he's back to the Blue Arrow we were hoping for, good things should be on the way for his patient fantasy owners."
+,"Kyle Kuzma scores career-high 22 points: Larry Nance Jr. (hand) is out indefinitely, so Kuzma has to be considered the favorite to take over as the starter at power forward. Kuzma has still logged some decent minutes next to the first-unit guys, but he's played an overwhelming majority of his minutes next to Julius Randle -- he's also rarely played small forward. The rookie has already played over 30 minutes three times this year, so saying he'll play in the low 30s feels like a certainty. We'd like to see him add more non-scoring stats, but he should be owned in all standard leagues."
+,"Darren Collison scores season-high 25 points: Like most point guards this season, Collison had his way with the Cavs defense. He's still be fairly effective this season and came in averaging 12.7 points, 7.1 dimes, 1.4 steals and 1.0 treys. The Pacers up-tempo style and Collison not getting any competition has led to him being a top-50 player in standard leagues. He may not be this good, but he should be a mid-round guy and should be owned in the shallowest of leagues."
+,"Aaron Gordon scores 19 in another win: He's a big reason why the Magic rank second in offensive rating in the NBA, and even more surprisingly they're third in the NBA in pace. Since Gordon returned from his ankle injury, he's averaged 22.0 points, 8.6 boards, 2.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 0.8 blocks and 2.8 treys on 60.9 percent from the field. Gordon cracks the top 15 for per-game value in standard leagues on the season, and his owners should believe he can be an early-round guy the rest of the way."
+,"T.J. McConnell adds another strong line: He has come on strong since Markelle Fultz (shoulder) has been shut down, averaging 11.0 points, 4.5 boards, 7.3 assists, 2.3 steals and 1.0 treys in his last four. In his 112 minutes over that span, McConnell has actually played 77 minutes next to Jerryd Bayless and 60 minutes next to Ben Simmons, so he's getting his run in all sorts of combinations. With Fultz out indefinitely, McConnell could be worth a look for those needing a point guard at any depth."
+,"Tim Hardaway leads Knicks with 23: Only Kristaps Porzingis and Enes Kanter joined THJ in double-digit scoring tonight, and looking at the Knicks' box score is a brutal exercise. After an incredibly slow start to the season, Hardaway is starting to turn it on, averaging 20.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.8 steals and 4.7 3-pointers over his last four games. He's one of the only pure scorers on a Knicks team desperate for it, so he should be good to go the rest of the way."
+,"Khris Middleton scores career-high 43 points: Coming off a 27-point game with nine assists, seven rebounds, three 3-pointers and two steals, the buy-low window was already slammed shut before this outburst.  Middleton hit 15-of-28 shots and 8-of-10 free throws, adding seven assists, five rebounds and five 3-pointers. The Hornets had no answer for him with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist leaving the game early with an illness, but Middleton's owners can expect more big lines from him going forward and we already know he has early-round upside when his shot is falling."
+,"Kyrie Irving scores 22; BOS wins 6th straight: After losing their first two games, this gives the Celtics an NBA-high six-game winning streak. They're doing it with defense with their top-ranked 95.1 defensive rating on the season, but their offense has been rolling with their fourth-ranked offensive rating in their six-game winning streak. Coach Brad Stevens has said he wants to get Irving even more involved, and he's posted his two highest usage rates in his last three games. His fluky bad start in isolation is behind him, so his fantasy owners can probably pencil him in for first-round value going forward."
+,"Frank Ntilikina goes for 8 dimes, 5 steals: Jarrett Jack started again tonight, but Ntilikina was the better player, although there was a lot of garbage time in this game. The assists and steals were both career highs for the rookie, and he's likely going to start pushing Jack for the starter's job. He's far from a must-own player, but if you're in a deep league and looking for a point guard stash, he probably fits the bill."
+,"Robin Lopez scores 22 points on 10-of-17 FGs: The fact that he did this against Hassan Whiteside makes it even more impressive. Lopez also hit a pair of free throws with four rebounds, two assists, one steal and a block in 34 minutes, and he's now scored in double digits in every game so far with averages of 15.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.3 blocks. Those are mid-round numbers, so Lopez is a possible sell-high candidate."
+,"Pau Gasol scores 11 points with six boards: His minutes have been fairly high lately with at least 25 minutes in each of his last four games. It's also worth a mention he played 30 and 25 minutes in his last back-to-back set, so perhaps Gasol gets a good amount of run in another back-to-back set on Friday. Gasol has been hanging around top-100 value in standard leagues and should be around that number for most of the season."
+,"Whiteside (knee) double-doubles in return: He was expected to be limited to 30 minutes, but only played 26 and looked pretty tired. That's to be expected though, and Whiteside's workload should ramp up on Friday vs. the Nuggets.  He became the first Heat player with at least 30 rebounds in his first two games of a season, and he was apparently serious about expanding his range this summer because he's now 2-of-2 from deep."
+,"Kemba Walker scores 26 in win over Bucks: The Bucks have given up the fifth most fantasy points to point guards this season, so Walker predictably went off. He had 20 points by halftime, and hes currently crushing his ADP by flirting with first-round value in 9-category leagues. He also made a bit of history by becoming the all-time franchise leader in games with 20+ points (193) and games with 25+ points (110)."
+,"Kris Dunn scores 11 points vs. Heat: The counting stats were nice, but Dunn wasn't efficient in this one and hit just 5-of-15 shots with five turnovers. He also missed all three of his 3-pointers and finished 1-of-2 from the line. He did outplay Jerian Grant and coach Fred Hoiberg said the starting PG spot is an open competition, so our money is on Dunn making starts sooner rather than later."
+,"Klay Thompson scores 27 points in 112-92 win: The Warriors looked like they were in for a rough night and even fell behind by 19 points in the first quarter, but they were able to pull out their 16th win when trailing by 15 or more in their last four seasons. Thompson also had another big block on LaMarcus Aldridge in this game and he's on pace for a career-high 1.0 per game this season. He's also been ridiculously efficient with a career-high 64.3 TS%. Thompson has been a second-round player so far and he's not sacrificing again this year."
+,"Paul Millsap scores season-high 20 points: He did almost of his damage in the first half with 19 points in 16 minutes, but the Nuggets had this game in the bag in the third quarter. Millsap is starting to turn the corner on the stat sheet with improvements in rebounding and defensive stats, so maybe the offense will heat up. There's still a chance to buy low on Millsap because the Nuggets offense still hasn't hit on all cylinders before tonight."
+,"Gary Harris scores 15 points in a win: He's just a terrific player on the stat sheet and in reality. Harris has been a fifth-round player in standard fantasy leagues with averages of 14.5 points, 2.4 boards, 2.8 assists, 1.5 steals and 2.6 treys on 50.0 percent from the field, and he came into tonight ranking first in the NBA for halfcourt defense (per Synergy, minimum 50 possessions). Harris is the real deal."
+,"Goran Dragic (illness) scores 20 points: After sitting out Tuesday's practice, Dragic seemed fine and was able to log 34 minutes. He hit 7-of-17 shots and 4-of-5 free throws, adding six assists, five rebounds, one steal and two triples. He's producing sixth-round value in standard 9-category leagues and there's still room to grow once his steals come back up."
+,"Nikola Jokic posts 8/16/10 line in easy win: He becomes the first player since 1992 to have at least 10 assists, at least 15 rebounds and no turnovers in a game (Charles Barkley). The scoring has been surprisingly low at times and hopefully this isn't because the Nuggets lost big-man assistant coach Chris Finch to the Pelicans -- Boogie Cousins apparently likes him. Low scoring game tonight aside, his fantasy owners really can't complain too much with averages of 20.3 points, 12.3 boards, 4.3 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.7 blocks and 1.8 treys over his last six games. He's still been a top-20 player per game and there's still some room for improvement. He's a good bet to be a top-10 player, especially because the Nuggets have been slower in pace than expected this year."
+,"Marc Gasol scores 22 points in loss: He was a game-time decision for this game and looked 100 percent. Despite the scary foot fracture from 2015-16, Gasol has been durable with 74 games last season and playing in every game so far at 34 minutes per night for both seasons. He's also on pace for career highs in points, boards, blocks, 3-pointers and free throw makes. He has third-round value so far this year and should be right in that neighborhood all season."
+,"Robert Covington (knee) scores 22 points: He went to the locker room with a right knee hyperflexion after Luke Babbitt crossed him up, but he returned shortly after without any issues. Covington hit 7-of-14 shots and six 3-pointers, adding three rebounds and two steals. He's rolling with top-24 value in standard 9-category leagues and it's the money stats (3s, steals and blocks) that makes him so valuable. We'll leave him off the injury report, but be on the lookout for an update just in case."
+,"Victor Oladipo scores 23 points with five 3s: He's been an offensive superstar in this early season with his 30.5 usage rate and a 62.7 TS% while running at a 104 pace. Plus, his assists seem to be trending up and of course his steals are back to what they looked like in Orlando. Oladipo is on cruise control as a top-20 player this season and his fantasy owners should be fairly confident he can keep it going."
+,"Rubio scores 30 to lead Jazz past Blazers: This was his second career game with 30 or more points (career-high is 33), and he was also super efficient, finishing 8-of-17 from the field and 11-of-11 from the line. 11 of his points came in overtime, and he also hit a huge 3-pointer with 30 seconds left in overtime. He's rolling with third-round value in 9-category leagues and there's no reason why he can't keep it up because he was a top-24 player after the break last season."
+,"Bradley Beal scores season-high 40 points: He scored at least 20 points in each of his first four games, but he only scored 19 combined in his previous two -- he was ejected in one of those games. Beal has been somewhat cold from deep at just 25.0 percent in his previous outings, but he's actually been one of the best pick-and-roll players in the NBA based on efficiency. He's playing huge minutes when garbage time isn't a factor and his rebounding is up, so expect him to flirt with first-round value in standard leagues."
+,"Dragan Bender gets 24 minutes: Coach Jay Triano has really talked up Bender's basketball IQ lately and he's been particularly good on the defensive end. We still haven't seen him have that head-turning stat line, but there is upside for blocks and treys in one of the NBA's fastest offenses. He has some standalone value in deeper leagues and should be on almost all watch lists."
+,"Dennis Schroder scores 25 in loss to 76ers: He was listed as probable prior to tip-off, but his status wasn't really in doubt. Needless to say, Schroder looked fine and added six assists, three boards, two triples and four turnovers in 33 minutes. He was the leader in touches per game (102.4) prior to Wednesday and just needs to stay healthy to have a big year."
+,"DeMarcus Cousins posts monster line vs. MIN: This is a candidate for fantasy line of the season, as Boogie hit 10-of-21 from the field and all 10 of his free throws. He's coexisting very nicely with Anthony Davis, as both players are ranked inside the top six in standard 9-category leagues. The bigger concern is that the Pelicans are 3-5 and sitting near the bottom of the Western Conference Standings."
+,"Kevin Durant scores 24 points vs. Spurs: He was off to a terrible start, missing his first eight shots to put the Warriors down early in this game. After that, Durant made his next seven shots and helped the Warriors take an early third-quarter lead. Durant is about as consistent as it gets as a scorer and he's just a shade under 50.0 percent from deep on the year while he's on pace for a career-high 3.0 treys per game. Besides a dip in free throw shooting, steals and more turnovers, KD's numbers look just as good as last year with a nice boost in blocks."
+,"Danny Green scores eight with two blocks: He continues to handle the ball more and he's taking more two-point attempts, as well. Green has consistently played good minutes this season because of the Spurs needing to fill the void left by Kawhi Leonard (quad), so he may not be as reliable once Kawhi is back. Although, Green was an early-round player in nine-cat leagues just a few seasons ago, so maybe he keeps it going. He should be owned in standard leagues."
+,"Karl-Anthony Towns held to two points in win: He only played 23 minutes with five rebounds, one steal and two blocks. KAT has been one of the most consistent players over the past year and has been held to single-digit points just 11 times in 171 career games. His owners can expect a massive bounce-back game against the Mavericks on Saturday, as they are allowing the fifth most fantasy points to opposing centers this season."
+,"Taurean Prince double-doubles vs. 76ers: He was averaging 3.3 turnovers per game prior to Wednesday, but took better care of the ball tonight with just one. Prince is really coming along over the past five games with averages of 15.2 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 2.0 triples and there's no reason why he can't keep it up."
+,"Malik Monk scores career-high 25, 5 treys: He was incredible down the stretch, scoring 18 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter. Monk became just the fifth Hornets rookie with 5+ 3-pointers in a game, and just the second rookie to do that this season (Lauri Markkanen is the other). As good as he was tonight, Monk took advantage of some extra playing time with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist leaving with an illness and will be hard to rely on going forward. Nicolas Batum (elbow) could also be back in a couple weeks. Monk is hot right now, hitting double digits in scoring in four of his last five games."
+,"Aron Baynes scores four in 23 minutes: It's going to be really interesting to see how coach Brad Stevens handles his power forward minutes once Marcus Morris comes back. Baynes and Al Horford have been dynamite together with their +22.1 net rating in 102 minutes together, so that combo should still be a key wrinkle in the rotation. Baynes should have value in deeper leagues."
+,"Malcolm Brogdon breaks out w/ 20 points: He hit 9-of-16 shots and missed his only free throw of the evening, adding four assists, one rebound, two triples and one turnover. Brogdon won't consistently light up the box score, but it's easy to see why the Bucks value him so highly -- they have been linked to Eric Bledsoe, but don't want to give up Brogdon in a potential deal."
+,"Joel Embiid matches career-high w/ 30 minutes: The 76ers are slowly starting to unleash him and his fantasy owners should start getting used to more lines like this. He finished 9-of-16 from the field and 2-of-5 from the line, and his outlook will keep improving if the 76ers keep climbing up the standings -- they've won four out of their last five games."
+,"Jayson Tatum scores 12 points in easy win: He's been way too good for Marcus Morris (knee) to take his minutes, right? In his rookie season, Tatum has a superstar-like 63.7 TS% and a very respectable 10.9 rebounding percentage. Morris has never had a rebounding percentage that high in any of his NBA seasons, and his best TS% isn't even close at 55.2 TS%. Tatum owners should continue to start him with confidence."
+,"Jaylen Brown out of slump with 22 points: After an 18-point Monday, he's officially out of his slump. Brown's minutes have still been very high with his 30.6 per game over his last five while adding 2.2 treys in that span. He's playing too well on both ends to lose any playing time, so he should be owned in all standard leagues."
+,"Gorgui Dieng steps up for Wolves: Karl-Anthony Towns had two points and five fouls in 23 minutes, so take Dieng's line with a grain of salt. He's been a really strong fantasy asset for the past couple years, but the arrival of Taj Gibson has ruined him this season and he was averaging just 5.4 points and 3.7 rebounds in 13.6 minutes per game prior to Wednesday."
+,"Marquese Chriss scores nine with 10 boards: He did get some key minutes late in this game and only had one foul. Dragan Bender is on the rise and for now coach Jay Triano doesn't want to play them together. While he's certainly not popping on the stat sheet, Chriss has still been a top-100 player in his last six games since coach Triano took over. If he can keep his fouls in check, he should be able to post mid-round value in around 24 minutes per game."
